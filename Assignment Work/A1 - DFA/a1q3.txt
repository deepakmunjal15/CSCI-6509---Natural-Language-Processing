The levels of NLP are - 

1. Phonetics -  
This comprises of study of the sounds of human speech. 
Physical sounds of language are processed.
Speech generation and analysis is done as part of this.

2. Phonology - 
It mainly deals with the systematic organization of sounds 
in languages. It is mostly concerned with phonemes. A phoneme 
is an elementary sound unit of a language.

3. Morphology - 
It mainly analyses the structure of the words and part of words. 
It is study of how different words are related to each other in 
the same language.

4. Syntax - 
It deals with the sentence structure.It is the grammatical arrangement 
of words in a sentence. With a sentence as input, parse tree is produced in this. 
These parse trees can be of various types like - Context-free parse trees and 
dependency parse trees.

5. Semantics - 
It is manily concerned with the meaning of the language upto sentence level.
Semantics has many branches like formal semantics, lexical semantics etc. 
Formal semantics deals with the logical aspects of meaning, while lexical 
semantics studies the word meanings and relations.

6. Pragmatics - 
This deals with the practical and intended meaning of a language and is mainly 
concerned about the context of language. Eg. "He saw the man with binoculars." 
this could mean he observed that man by using binoculars, or it could also mean 
that he observed a man who was holding binoculars. This is the ambiguity in pragmatics.

7. Discourse - 
This deals with the spoken or written communication or debate and is mainly 
concerned about language structure beyond sentence level. Document structure, 
inter-sentence relations and references are studied in this. Eg. speech acts.
