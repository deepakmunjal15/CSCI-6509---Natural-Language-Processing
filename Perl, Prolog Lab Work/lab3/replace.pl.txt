###Below you would need to add a missing line of code
###that will replace within the default variable
###all the occurances of case-insensitive 'book' (book, Book, BOOK, etc)
###with the lowercase string 'book'
###MISSING LINE GOES HERE
    if(/(^book$|\sbook\s|^book\s|\sbook$)/i){s/book/book/gi;}
#This will convert all occurances of word "book", independent of case sensitiv
#ity, in a line to lowercase. This has been written in such a way so as to 
#handle only the word "book", in any case, stricly. this means it won't convert
#substring containing book but only the word book as a whole.
### AFTER THE MISSING LINE

    print; #this line prints the default variable $_
}
