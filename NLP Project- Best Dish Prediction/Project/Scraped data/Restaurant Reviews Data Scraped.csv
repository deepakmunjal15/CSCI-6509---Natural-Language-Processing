https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"My favorite brunch I had on a recent trip to Halifax. Their focaccia french toast with nut butter, ricotta cheese, fruit, and bacon was absolutely unreal. As someone who doesn't love sweet-smothered breakfasts, this concoction managed to be savoury + sweet without being a sugar overkill at the same time. A beautiful space as well!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Well....I was less than impressed. Actually kind of underwhelmed. I heard it was super great last summer, but unfortunately my fall visit was a bit meh. The space is beautiful and welcoming, but a bit cold. The staff were nice, but not super forthcoming with specials. We went specifically for whiskey wednesday, but there were no signs advertising it,so we just went a head with some happy hour drinks, which are a good deal. After the third drink, she mentioned the whiskey options. I think there were 5. I was not impressed. Usually a ""Whiskey Wednesday"" means selection. The menu looked fun and interesting. So we ordered a few things to share. The portions were so tiny, and the prices so high. I was confused. The place didn't have that air to it. Much better deals/food can be found at countless other downtown joints. Nothing about here made me scream that I wanted to come back.Maybe I'll give it another shot in the summer."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Was here recently with a party of 5. They only take reservations for 6+ so we had called earlier and asked if we should be okay for a table at 7:30 (on a Saturday night) they said it shouldn't be a problem at all. We arrived at that time and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We got drinks at a local brewpub and came back in 45 mins they were nice to reserve that spot for us. However, the party at that table were still not done yet. We sat at the bar for another 30 mins or so (it's a super small restaurant and bar but luckily there was room). Although we had to wait the manager gave us our drinks at the bar on the house. When we finally sat down we ordered nachos and calamari. The menu is set up as small and large plates. The nachos were great-calamari only okay. My final impression when my meal was over (we all ordered large plates for ourselves) was that it's a great place for cocktails/wine and to share some small appetizer plates but I was not super impressed by the larger portions. I've heard the brunch is great so would love to try that!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Wow. Too date this has been the best meal I've had in Halifax. Everything works and is not a chef trying to be show off simply by being different. Everything was perfect. The french toast, the chicken sandwich, the Benny, gnocchi, the rabbit ragu, and more so many other good menu items to choose from. The atmosphere is lively and relaxing. It's better to go in the summer only because you can enjoy the outside space. The waiter was on point with recommendations and information."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Great place if you are looking for a brunch spot in downtown Halifax. This not your typical brunch place where you will find bacon and eggs but rather they have a modern twist to their menu. My boyfriend and I ordered their Diner breakfast which comes with eggs, smoked bacon, andouille sausage, focaccia bread and fries or salad. The tomato jam that came with it was so good! The dish overall had a unique flavour and was the perfect portion for a brunch meal. I am sure that their dinner menu also serves up some unique tasting dishes.This resto totally spoke up to its name. The food was delicious and the ambience was dimmly lit and cozy. Their was also a portrait of a black sheep hanging on the wall just beside our table. And not to mention, the wonderful service throughout our meal. I can see why yelpers like this place and why it's always packed on weekends!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,Enjoyed the ecclectic pub menu with a young professional clientel. The brisket nachos were a first and amazingly.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"I feel kinda bad that I have to give this spot a lower then normal rating. The good:Food is fantasticLocation is greatDrinks are delicousAtmosphere is lovely, especially by the barWhy did I have to give this spot a less than stellar rating. My last visit ended before I could even get through the door. Came for brunch on a Saturday around noon. It was busy, which was expected, so I was happy to wait. After checking in with staff to let them know were were there, we waited 20 min for the next table and were ignored by wait staff who gave our table to a couple who arrived 10 min after us.When I told the wait staff they took our table, I was shrugged off and told I would have an hour wait. Customer service was sub-par at best. Would I recommend going there? Yes, the food makes up for this bad experience but I am hoping on my next visit the treatment is a bit better."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Came here for a lunch date on Tuesday and it was great. This place is tucked away behind a tanning studio and Indian restaurant on Dresden row. The decor is nice, but simple. It is however a little dark, which I didn't mind, it made for a nice intimate, quiet lunch. I didn't try the drinks as I had to return to work when finished, but they serve drinks here and I do hear they're good. At lunch time they had a decent selection of breakfast foods if that's your thing. My friend ordered a tostada with tofu chorizo and poached egg and I had the ravioli with sweet potato and goat cheese. I hate puttanesca sauce because of the anchovies and they said they could sub it for the tomato soup they have, which didn't sound very good but I tried it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised as the tomato soup did make a really nice sauce. The ravioli was awesome. The portion size was perfect and I definitely didn't feel overstuffed but it was still filling. It was a well balanced dish, the sweet potato, basil and goat cheese together was delicious, but I can see why they used puttanesca with it as it was a touch sweet. I imagine if you were an anchovy fan the saltiness from the puttanesca and the sweetness from the ravioli would be great. Either way it was awfully tasty. My friends tostada was really good too, it had more rice in it than I thought it would, but the portion was big and she didn't finish it. I had a bite and it was very good. The chorizo tofu is a cool idea and I feel like it'd still make a good dish for a vegan if the poached eggs were omitted. We finished up the meal with java blend coffee which of course is always great. The only downside of my meal here was that it took a long time to receive our food. If you're coming here from work and have time constraints I'm not sure if I'd gamble it. I'd definitely come back and try some of the other delicious sounding stuff on the menu. The breakfast/brunch stuff sounds great. Reasonably priced as well! Check it out."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"4.5 star review on Yelp, I HAD to make a visit! And, as I do, reading the menu beforehand, I had my heart set on the French Toast with cashew butter... but I suspect the menu has changed in the last year. The French Toast now comes with cranberry jam and ginger granola, neither of which really appealed to my tastes, so I ordered the Diner Breakfast instead (2 eggs, double smoked bacon, andouille sausage, toasted foccacia with blueberry & basil jam and a choice of fries, salad or half and half). The service so far today (Sunday, 1130), though, has been less than impressive and has taken a 4-star review down to a 3. I dined solo today, as I often do when I travel for work, and the guy walked right by me at the front to ask the 3 groups of people who walked in after me for tables. When I told him that I had come in prior to any of these groups, all he could say was ""Oh, I thought you were with him"" (referring to the guy behind me, also on his own). Then when I sat at the bar, the bartender asked if he could help me decide. So I took him up on the offer, and asked which was better: the Diner Breakfast or French Toast. All he had to say, verbatim, was ""Well, the French toast is sweet..."" before walking away. (I was hoping he could tell me something I didn't know). It only took 28 minutes for my food to arrive, fortunately it tastes as good as it looks. I understand it's Sunday brunch, it's a little busy, but some communication would have been appreciated. Will try again next time I'm here."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"This was my first time at Black sheep. The food was pretty good, but the fact that we were actually ASKED TO LEAVE the restaurant because our table was needed for a reservation? I left with a pretty sour taste in my mouth. We had to wait for about 10-15 mins before we could even put our order in and then once we had finished our meal, our meal was cleared, we paid our bills and they cleaned our table while we were still finishing our drinks all in the span of 5 mins. The waitress was extremely condescending throughout the meal and 5 mins after our bills were paid, the waitress came and said "" Please be aware that we have a line up and we do need this table for a reservation"", and we still had not even finished our drinks. Now it's not like we ate and sat there forever, we sat there for 5 mins after. FIVE MINUTES. After we had just paid for our $25+ meal?? We were less than impressed. But because of this bad service, we will not be back and will not be recommending this place to anyone else."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Have been for both brunch and dinner, and left very happy on each occasion! Tonight I had the brisket nachos, fried chicken thighs, and tiramisu, as well as a Rhubarb Sour cocktail. Everything was fresh and delicious, especially those nachos; so yummy! The restaurant itself is super cozy and perfectly dim. And the service was exceptional. Our waitress was so sweet and personable. We will definitely be back!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"This place is really good. It's tucked away quite well, so it has this ""hidden gem"" feel. The dim lighting adds to that, I feel. The food is excellent and the menu has something for everyone (same with the beverage menu). The service is generally friendly, and they make for a pleasant experience.I used to come here quite often, say, once a week or so. Their prices recently went up and my visits have been a tad more infrequent -- one of the big hooks for me was that it was a place with superb food that was superbly priced. I understand that it is a business, and they have to do what they have to do, but it was a little disappointing to me. During my past couple visits the service slowed, and one time it took nearly half an hour to receive my meal. The atmosphere makes for easy socialization, so it didn't seem to be too long a wait, but I can see how that would irritate some people. Also, it's worth noting that they do not take reservations (so if you have a large group, you may or may not get a seating arrangement that suits you).Despite the above, I gave them four stars because the atmosphere and food are great, and I have had quite a few genuinely good visits. I recommend you to try it once, at the very least -- it's a nice little place that you might not have noticed before."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Great brunch place, busy (as you approach noon) but quiet enough to have a private conversation comfortably without shouting. Food was fantastic- highly recommend breakfast benny. Excellent service, was not rushed to leave despite line forming outside."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,I've been here twice and both experiences were good. I was surprised to see it wasn't busier. The best part of Black Sheep is interesting and unique flavour concoctions though it worked in some dishes but not others. They have some great drinks and would definitely pop in for a drink and appetizer again.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"My roommate and I are really into brunch lately so every Sunday we try and get out somewhere new. We both heard that Black Sheep offered a killer brunch so that's exactly where we decided to go last Sunday. When we arrived there was a little bit of a wait which was expected on a Sunday at 1pm especially at such a popular spot, but even so it was just around 15 minutes which we were fine with.Once we were seated our server was extremely kind and enthusiastic to help us with any questions we may have had with the menu. She even gave us recommendations based on her favourite dishes and what was popular which was helpful. She always kept our water glasses and coffee mugs topped up (the little things).I had the B.S. Breakfast Sandwich with fries and my roommate had the Brisket Benny with fries and both were great and filled with flavour. The garlic aioli that came with the fries for dipping was extremely special due to the black colour (which our server told us was coloured with squid ink, very cool!) and the great taste.The atmosphere was busy and filled with energy which I definitely like in a brunch spot. Overall our experience was great and I'll definitey be back!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Excellent! So glad we choose this place for our last meal (brunch) in Halifax!Food, atmosphere and service were all excellent. Eggs benny and french toast (my husband and i shared both) were the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I would love to come back here for dinner as well as cocktails which have modern twists on old classics."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,I had egg Benny... it's very good!! I love this little small place... already marked as one of my favourite brunch Benny place. My friend had the fried chicken sandwich... she loved it too..great brunch place to go!!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"A nice little out of the way spot for a drink and a snack or meal. Good stuff on tap, great custom cocktails, and an awesome popcorn maker behind the bar to serve up yummy bar flavours like white truffle and parmesan. I've tried a couple of their cocktails and the flavours are sophisticated and a little different. Good selection of beers, and a variety of dishes. The service has been great both times I've been in, attentive and friendly, without any hovering. I look forward to many more after work drop ins and trying the rest of the menu out!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Finally, got a chance to try BLACK SHEEP.I ordered rabbit ragu, and my friend had diner breakfast . We also shared French Toast since both of us wanted try it. Obviously, We couldn't finish all of them. Lol Rabbit ragu was good but a little bit fatty. I tried my friend's poutine. It was really tasty. French Toast was ok. I also had cocktial. I couldn't recall the name ...it's a long name. Ayw, I liked it but pricy. Overall, 4 starsDefinitely, will will back to here to try other stuffs"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-sheep-halifax?hrid=76u5n4ghDbCIoq7ur8XGRg,Black Sheep,"Had the opportunity to visit last night and Wow! The food, drinks and service were all outstanding. Went with two friends. We each ordered something different - the burger, gnocchi and octopus. My order was the gnocchi. It was beautifully cooked and the mushroom gravy/blue cheese sauce were excellent. I am not a fan of octopus but tried it anyway. While it is still probably not something I would order, it was very tender and tasty. The person who did order it said it was some of the best octopus he'd ever eaten. I did not try the burger but did try the fries. They were golden, crispy, and delicious. Everything a fry should be! The cocktail menu was very interesting. Two on menu drinks were ordered - The Islander and It's Always Sunny on Dresden. The Islander tasted like a Jolly Rancher at the front and a hit of cayenne at the back - totally took the edge off the sweetness. Always Sunny was very refreshing with a nice ginger beer finish. The bartender, Andrew, also made me two ""not on menu"" cocktails, after quizzing me on my likes and dislikes, which had no name; or at least not that I remember. The first had lots of Campari but some sweetness to balance it out. Reminiscent of a Negroni but more complex. The second was a little sweeter but only at the front then very herbaceous at the back. He took a lot of care making every cocktail that was ordered; tasting to make sure that each was perfect before handing over to the waiters.The space itself is very cozy and inviting. We sat at the bar and there was plenty of eating room for us and three more customers.Prices are extremely reasonable for food and drinks. Sufficed to say, we will be going back to sample more of the food items and Andrew's yummy cocktails!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"Spontaneously stopped in for an afternoon snack - so impressed and glad that I did. Tried the imam bayildi (roasted eggplant vegetable dish) with fresh pita to dip, with a delicious baklava to follow - both were absolutely delicious. The baklava hit the sweet craving without overwhelming sweetness, will definitely recommend to anyone visiting Halifax. A very pleasant atmosphere and kind staff who are friendly and willing to chat about the dishes and culture! A quiet spot right off of Spring Garden. A new favorite, to say the least."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"Having read sterling reviews of Lemon Tree, I wandered over one sunny day for dinner.This quaint, family-run restaurant on Queen Street recently got a large mural of their namesake plant on the front of their building, so they stick out a bit more from all of the boutique thrift and consignment stores on that block. There was no one in their small downstairs seating section, although I heard a stir of voices from upstairs, so I decided to sit there and take in the sun through their large front window. The room is heavily decorated with Turkish trinkets and lamps, along with art for sale on the walls. Their kitchen is located at the far end of the room, so I was able to hear the chatter from there, and while it was Turkish, sounded like a family enjoying working together.After being seated, I was poured a glass of refreshing lemonade in a cool hammered metal cup, and it hit the spot after strolling around the waterfront that afternoon.The menu is divided into two sections - mezes (apps/sharing plates) and entrees, which were primarily kebabs and koftes, with about 15 of each. Wanting to try as much as I could, I ordered piyaz, a white kidney bean meze, and the mixed kebab plate.I received the piyaz fairly quickly, along with several triangles of pita bread. The beans were nice and tender, not at all chalky, and had very fresh flavour from the parsley and just a hint of mint. The pita was amazing; fluffier than Lebanese pitas, but not as bready as Greek, it struck the perfect balance. With a buttery flavour on the outside, and some light charring from being warmed on the grill, this was a great example of how memorable a normally inconsequential item can be when it's done well. My mixed kebab plate came before I had finished my piyaz, but I had been taking my time, savouring both the bread and the beans. On the upside, there was a lot of food - a beef skewer, meatballs, chicken, rice, shredded carrot in a yogurt sauce, salad (diced cucumber, tomato, green pepper), and yes, more pita. On the downside, there was a *lot* of food. Not helping my belly capacity issue was that I had a lobster roll an hour before. Luckily though, I had tons of time to kill so I could just take my meal at my own pace.Normally I'm pretty hesitant about getting koftes or their like at Mediterranean places as the meat is often tough and dry. However, these meatballs were super tender and juicy, with a lightly herbal seasoning. The chicken and beef both had some light charring from the grill and were perfectly cooked as well. I wasn't sure what the carrot was at first since it wasn't on the menu, but it was shredded somewhere in between the large and fine holes on your typical box grater. I don't think it was cooked, and if it was only extremely briefly, rather just made tender from the yogurt sauce it was in. Tangy and slightly sweet, and retaining just a bit of crunch, it was quite enjoyable. The actual salad was A-OK, with fresh veggies and I enjoyed that it didn't have pallid, yellow iceberg lettuce in it like many salads at this time year. I enjoyed the execution on the basmati rice; light and fluffy, and slightly buttery, it was what all plain rice should aspire to be - simple, but great.I'm not a tea guy, but I tried some Turkish tea. It tasted like many other teas to me, but I enjoyed it with just the tiniest bit of sugar in it. Service throughout my time there exemplified the best side of a family-run business: friendly and welcoming, but still attentive with check ins on the food and top ups for the drinks. This and the food were so great that a group of young guys that were settling up were saying to one of the owners that the they should franchise. While I don't think this sort of thing is replicable on a large scale, I'm really happy with what Lemon Tree is doing on their own."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,Love it! If you are in the mood for some home style Turkish food this place is where you should be. Cozy atmosphere friendly people. And the food is awesome!!It starts with a tasty lemonade in traditional cooled brass cups.. the menu is simple and clear. . The food is wonderful..decent quantities...I felt like I'm back to my grandma's house waiting for the delicious treats and tasty goods..Love it! It's my new favorite spot for Turkish food..
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"I wanted to go outside the box and try something extra special, and, having read the positive reviews of the Lemon Tree from my fellow Yelpers, I thought this would be the perfect time to see if those reviews were justified.There are two separate floors were you can dine - the more spacious area is up top compared to the bottom - but the latter is more cozier and that's where we decided to sit. We were given complimentary lemonade from our server, which was a refreshing change from the usual water, and it was a nice surprise to find out later that there were free refills as well. While I was tempted to have the chicken kebab combo, I remembered that I was having a similar meal with the family the next day, so I went with the Smyrna Kofte Combo. This combo consists of meatballs, rice, salad, and some pita bread.When I received the plate from the server, I knew straight away that this would be a positive experience; the white rice was probably the best I ever had, the meatballs had some spice to it, but it was not over-the-top, and the salad was great too. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the Yogurt Kofte Combo as well; his combo was similar to mine, but his plate had yogurt and tomato sauce over it.The meal itself came in at just under $14.00 - a steal of a deal for such high-quality food - and I'm more than looking forward to returning again to try the chicken kebab. "
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"I read reviews about this place online and Last night me and couple friends decide to visit this place, especially because they organize belly dancing from 8:30 until midnight on every Fridays. Being a vegetarian the food was too light for our tummy. The food was really nice warm and fresh. The owner are very polite and welcoming people. The dancer. ""Sari"" is so beautiful and talented dancer. She even takes dance classes if anyone interested. We ordered 2 vegetarian combo (don't expect large portion sizes) and baklava. Paid 45$ incl tax and tip. If you are a vegan or vegetarian you don't have something to make you feel stuff but go if you'd like to eat light someday. I would go there again not just for food but also for the staff there. Amazing! I do recommend this lil hidden gem."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"A small place at downtown Halifax owned by one of the most friendliest host couple I have ever met. You can see them prepare the food from fresh healthy ingredients. I am not a Turkish so I admit I am not an expert of Turkish food. But the home made style food and refreshing lemonade do warm and freshen you up.They have more space up stairs but me and my colleague decided to enjoy our dinner beside the ground floor table by the window. Not fancy but well decorated and comfortable setting.I ate too much of their yummy fresh bread thus I didn't have space to try their dessert. I will save that for next time I am in town again. Sometimes, what fill your heart is good comfort food and friendliest hospitality. There is no need for high price tag and fanciness. Definitely recommended to give it a try."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,This place is a hidden jem. After accidentally stumbling across it on monday I went 2 more times and brought a lot of my colleagues along who all agreed it's incredible with amazing prices and giant portions. I'll probably become their most loyal customer. LOVE this place. I cannot say enough good things.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"Had a very tasty dinner here. Two of us split the vegetarian combo, which allowed us to try multiple dishes. Good flavour, including some of the best hummus and baba ghanouj I've had in Halifax. The flatbread was delightfully warm.The ambiance is warm, a bit kitschy, and it felt like we were in their living room, but it felt cozy and welcoming on a cold night."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,Six stars! Give this wonderful little spot six stars! Our best Halifax meal by far.

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/lemon-tree-restaurant-halifax?hrid=Q8UYsMGl-5FBYty-Gx5BNA,Lemon Tree Restaurant,"I strictly recommend the Stew and Moussaka. It is real Turkish food!I am from the Netherlands and the options over there are very varied for me. And as I am from Turkish descent you can imagine that my mom is very skilled when it comes to cooking.So long story made short, I know what to eat.. But I am definitely not disappointed. It is the best in Halifax for sure. Varied veggie plates, you can mix the plate with different vegetarian dishes each time. Muli and Cino are very friendly and welcoming. Each Sunday morning, with my group of friends we are having a very extended breakfast with 'cigborek'. Muli's specialty.. it is a turkish pastry with grounded beef in it. Oh can't wait till next"

Love their breakfast (order menemen it is delicious) we knew this famous Turkish dish and it wasn't listed on their menu when we asked the super nice lady about it she said "" I can do it for you"" she did it for us!! They put for us cheese, fruits and vegetables without adding that to our bills!! Everyone in our group was happy we feel that we are in our home."

Food is fresh and like homemade and very reasonable prices; the lamb stew is the best weve ever had. The owners are very welcoming and make you feel like family.The dining areas are very cozy with lots of cushions. The upstairs dining room is great for a quiet, intimate lunch on a rainy day. They also serve lemonade at the table instead of water, which is a very nice touch (it's free!). Definitely my favourite place to eat in the city."

The best lemonade I've ever had served by the nicest people I've ever met,and it's included! I'm very fussy about Turkish food because I compare it to my mom's. This didn't disappoint. Very authentic and it was made from scratch. This is a hidden gem. Very affordable and tasty. Try it!!!!"

The upstairs was quiet and cool,and the lemonade we were served was fantastic. I had the chicken kebab meal, which was amazing. Every element on the plate was extremely well prepared. The chicken had more of a fried, rather than grilled, texture and flavour that I have experienced at other Mediterranean restaurants, but it was delicious. All in all, for the prize, you get a lot of food,and the lemonade comes with refills. A must try!"

It's housed in a small space on Birmingham near thee Central Library and is easy to overlook if you aren't looking for it. But you're going to want to look for it.Backoos has a nice selection of tasty Korean dishes from KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) to bibimbap and kimchi fried rice. I've so far only had the bibimbap, though I've tried both the veggie and beef and they're both amazing. Oh mah gawd. It's everything I could want in a meal - warm, filling, perfectly seasoned and quick. The bibimbap bowls are only $5 and you can't get anything better than that.My husband has ordered the chicken combo and I tried some of the chicken and miso soup. The miso is super earthy and so delicious - I don't get miso soup often, but this my favourite. The chicken is melt-in-your-mouth worthy, and it's too delicious to describe with words. You've just gotta go try it yourself.Next up on my list from Backoos? The KFC. I can't wait."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"Might have expected a bit more given the raving reviews, although I might have ordered the wrong items.Backoos was near my hotel when I was in Halifax, so I decided to order takeout from here for dinner. I was tempted to go with the whole fried chicken, but since I was eating by myself I didn't think I would finish it. Therefore I went with the medium dakgongjung, cause I figure I'd still get the fried chicken experience the reviews were talking about.The prices were probably what made this place stand out, as I did manage to fill myself up for less than $10. However I found the fried chicken to have too much batter and too little meat. The batter was also not very good unfortunately, it was a bit too much on the chewy side. Sauce was good though, as was the rice.Not bad for a quick, cheap, fill you up place IMO. Maybe the whole fried chicken is better as well, and I'd be better off eating with friends for the whole fried chicken."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"I think I found my new fried chicken place. A block and a half off of Spring Garden Road is this small Korean fried chicken restaurant in a house (I believe it used to be a pizza place). Most people take there food out although there are a few stools to eat at a counter.Had a whole chicken and tried half and half. Wow, it was amazing! The chicken is twice fried so it's less greasy than the usual fried chicken you get at the usual suspects.Be prepared to wait for your food - big tip is to order ahead! Had to wait approximately one hour to get an entire fried chicken (maybe this was a function of it being a Saturday night)It's pretty hard to settle for KFC when for $23.95 you get an entire chicken that is miles better and higher quality! Will be back - may try some of their other non-chicken dishes."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"HALIFAX! Do you know that you have a place making Korean Fried Chicken right on the peninsula? Dear sweet mother of mercy, why are you not giving them all your money for mouthfuls of fried, saucy, chicken-y goodness?This, the best kind of KFC, was the foodie trend in Australia when I lived there last year. And Backoos, a tiny unassuming takeaway restaurant not from from SGR, has it. You need to get it in your gob, whether it's the small bite-sized pieces of dakgangjeong in a cup, or an entire chicken cut-up and fried and sauced until your mouth explodes.It's a small place with only a couple of stools and a small counter for a quick lunch in. You're better off getting it to go.Sure, they seem to have a menu of other foodstuffs, but why would you bother?"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"After seeing a picture of their menu board on Twitter, I knew I'd have to stop by to try out the Korean fried chicken (KFC that you don't have to be ashamed of eating) at this new downtown eatery.Stopping in around 4pm on a Tuesday, it was pretty quiet in the small shop, other than the stream of music videos playing on the TV. I'm not even sure what the source was given that MuchMusic and MTV barely play any music these days.Ordering at the main counter, I went with the sweet and spicy chicken combo ($8.50) which comes with rice, salad and miso soup, and I tacked on a bottle of water as well. Sitting down at the small counter running along the window, I took in some Adele and other pop music mixed with the sizzle of the deep fryer in the back and notes of spice in the air.It wasn't long before I had my container of grub and was on my way elsewhere to dig in. Upon opening the container, the first thing you're going to see is the respectably-sized pile of deeply red hunks of chicken. I'm pretty far from being a Korean food expert, but I assume that their ubiquitous fermented chili paste, gojuchang, plays a leading role in this chicken. The hint of fermented tang to it would suggest that as well. That, combined with the spice and slight crispness to the chicken made for a tasty entree. I'm not entirely confident that the pieces of chicken didn't come out of a bag: they weren't that mushy texture that frozen chicken can be, or overly dry, just not particularly moist and way too uniform.A pleasant surprise was a couple fried dumplings, which were crispy on the outside, and juicy and pork-tastic inside. The steamed rice was cooked perfectly and was easy to eat with chop sticks. My salad seemed to be run of the mill, creamy coleslaw. It was a bit disappointing in that it would have been nice to try a Korean salad, but it actually helped balance out the heat of the spicy chicken.The cup of miso soup was nice as well, with a mild broth that still had a nice umami flavour, with bits of konbu and ultra-tender cubes of tofu.All in all, it was a very well rounded meal, and at a very good price. They're a unique business in the city, so I hope they can carve out the niche they deserve and I'll be back in the near future so that I can try out their battered chicken."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"Had a chance to try out this spot with my fiance. No frills, confusing menu, delicious food. Its a challenge to park here, but take out is the way to go. The miso soup offered with the lunch is arguably one of the best in the city. $23 for two combos was a steal. Being a fan of Korean food, I was surprised when the owner had to ""check"" if I could get Kimchi to go- essentially the equivalent of McDonald's not having Ketchup. The chicken in the combo was covered in a rich mayo type sauce. Give this spot a try, we'll be back."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"This Korean restaurant is on Birmingham about two blocks from the Central Library. I found it easily. It was my first time here, although I have been to the one on the Bedford Highway a few times. The girl who took my order was friendly and helpful. I had the japchae appetizer. It was freshly made for me in the kitchen while I waited. It came hot and there was lots of it. I ate it in the restaurant. I would have liked to have had a little kimchee to eat with it. They have a good menu with a number of delicious dishes at reasonable prices. The restaurant was busy while I was there. I will be back to try other dishes."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"Been wanting to go here for a few weeks and finally stopped in. Ordered a whole chicken half and half. Half plain and half sweet and spicy. There are several other options including honey garlic and green onion. It was cooked fresh while we waited. The sign said its best to call ahead for a whole chicken ... Good advice. Our order was taken by the man at the counter , we paid and then he disappeared into the back to cook. The smells in the shop were incredible. He was completely focused on our meal. Others came in but he continued on with our order. We could hear all the food being prepared. The chicken hit the fryer. Ahhhh, nothing quite like that sound. We had also ordered japchae. Used to having that cooked and ready to go but once again, it was cooked to order. It took about 30 minutes so definitely call ahead if you're not good with waiting. We rushed home with our food. Took the obligatory picture for social media and dug in. It was so worth the wait! The chicken was perfectly cooked. It had been cut into bite sized pieces making it easy to eat. The japchae was beautifully seasoned and delicious. Batter is like a tempura as opposed to dredged and no seasoning to speak of on the plain. The sweet and spicy was cooked so the sauce was caramelized. It comes with two salads - pickled daikon and fruit. I am a fried chicken fiend and this was definitely top 5 fried chicken Ive eaten. This meal could easily feed 4 normal appetite humans. Two of us barely made a dent. They have daily combo specials. Look forward to our next trip."

I can see having that as a meal just by itself.The coleslaw was I think just shredded cabbage and was very good...It came with 2 dumplings which I did not know and order a side of dumplings the same time.The dumplings were not hot but had a nice crunch as they are fried and the meat filling was very tasty.Highly recommend this place to anybody.It took a bit of time getting the food once ordered but it was worth the wait... as all good food takes time to prepare."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"A friend and my wife mentioned that there is a new Korean fried chicken restaurant that is a hole in the wall on Birmingham Street. I never heard of a Korean fried chicken before, but a restaurant that combined two types of food I enjoy led to a prompt visit (a coupon that came in the mail also helped!). The place is a hole in a wall - but not a run down dirty one. It is small, but clean and well kept. I order a half original chicken and half sweet and spicy chicken to go along with a Bibimbap beef cup (ordering a whole chicken ahead by phone is recommended). I found it awesome that it came in a pizza box! The original chicken had a great batter (light, crisp and flaky) and the sweet and spicy one had great taste that has a slow spicy build up. The best thing is that the chicken was moist and tender - no dried up meat or evidence that it had been under heat lamp waiting. The beef cup was simply delicious! I loved the medium sunny side up egg over a cup of beef, rice and a delicious spicy sauce. The second time I went, I ordered two combos. I ordered the sweet and spicy chicken combo which had the same sauce as the half chicken I first ordered but this time cut up into bite sized morsels. It comes with deep fried dumplings, rice, salad and miso soup. I also ordered the very yummy kimchi fried rice which was a real treat! With the same sunny side egg over the rice, it had bacon and kimchi cabbage throughout the rice basked in the red kimchi sauce. Incredible!I would recommend this to anyone who likes fried chicken and spicy oriental food. Would visit this place again to try out the other dishes offered on the menu!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"I had a bit of a rough day today, and when I got home couldn't think of cooking. My husband suggested we get some take-out from the new chicken place in the neighbourhood, and am I ever glad he did. We ordered the half and half combo with sweet and spicy and soy and garlic chicken. Fried chicken is a fantastic cure-all for what ails you. The breading was crunchy and the chicken was delicious. I loved the little bit of funk you get from the gojuchang with the sweet and spicy flavour. The soy and garlic was amazing too, definitely not something to eat before a first date -perfect for a couple of garlic lovers like us. It came with a fruit salad and some pickled daikon as others have described, this part of the meal was a little ho-hum for us -pretty sure the fruit is just from a tin. Very friendly, we called ahead and were told to come pick-up at 6 and our order was ready and hot when we got it home. So glad this little place has moved into the neighbourhood, highly recommended for some fantastic fried chicken!"

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,"Have gone several times for the fried chicken combo meal. Chicken, rice, dumplings, coleslaw and miso soup for just under 10$ hits the right price point. The first time I had the chicken I was hooked and have told lots of my coworkers about the place. A meal to go in about ten mins works great for lunch break."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/backoos-korean-togo-food-halifax?hrid=hnG1m4Z9q23OY7hbWXSw_g,Backoos Korean ToGo Food,I came to the restaurant a few days after they had officially opened. My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken half and half (Half sweet and spicy chicken and half fried chicken.) The portion size was generous and the food was delicious! The owner was very kind and helpful. It was a little bit pricey but the quality of the food made it well worth it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"Was craving some asian food after a few days of indulging in various seafood restaurants. This was the first thai resto that came on the list with the best ratings and it sure did not lie. The moment we walked into the restaurant, we noticed takeout orders going out every 5 minutes! The restaurant was massive for a Thai place and fairly busy for a Sunday night. The service was pretty friendly and efficient and all the servers knew how to speak fluent english so was thinking to myself how authentic is this place.But I must mention that the service was overall pretty top notch because they actually have a mini handicap elevator where the server actually helped a patron get to the lower level where the entrance was. This is something you wouldn't normally see in an Asian restaurant.So my bf and I ordered the fried spring rolls, chicken panang curry and the spicy seafood noodle. All 3 dishes were so fresh and delicious. Having tried many panang dishes back in Toronto, this place might been one of the best. The curry was well balanced and was bursting with flavour. The spicy seafood noodle was also a surprise - it had a unique taste to it (different than that of pad thai) and had tons of seafood in it. The portions were massive for both dishes, they definitely didn't cheap out on the ""meat"" of both. The only thing that was different is that they charged $3.00 for a bowl of rice which normally comes with any thai curry dish. Pretty pricey just for a bowl so make sure you try to eat most of it!Overall, a hidden gem in Halifax and would totally come back here again if i'm in the city."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"A great place to go when you've got a hankering for some great Thai food in Halifax. Seeing that my fellow Yelpers really love this place, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I ordered the green curry chicken for the lunch special and was very impressed by the quality of the good, the size of the portions, and just how beautiful the plate was, right down the the beautiful purple flower (which tasted absolutely horrible). Kidding, kidding. I really enjoyed my meal here and I'd even dare say this restaurant was one of the best Thai places I've ever been to- and Thai food is the best."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,Great Thai restaurant!! Recently moved and we were skeptical that we would find a Thai restaurant to replace our old Thai place. This restaurant exceeded our expectations. Excellent service that is quick in a good sized restaurant. The menu had lots of variety. We had masaman curry and pad Thai. Both were generous portions! The food was very good and they seasoned everything very nicely. Great value for your money. We will be back

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"Although this was absolutely delicious, I was a little surprised that the lunch vegetable curry cost so much when the regular size is about twice as much and only a dollar more. Hm... Was otherwise a very nice place, and obviously popular; when I was finished lunch at 12:30 pm the line was heading out the door."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"I got the curry which was quite good. Service was polite and fast, but what bothered me was they charged for rice. It's a curry dish after all. It should come with the rice. Another thing that kinda bothered me was the interior was too plain. Overall I would go again though if I'm in the area."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,Another special restaurant in Halifax. We ordered the fresh basil rolls..and they were freshly made. The cashew curry with a wide variety of vegetables tasted great with the pork and shrimp we added. We also enjoyed our conversation with our waitress who suggested a very nice Canadian Pinot Grigio.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"Yes yes yes! I had the green curry chicken lunch special and my boyfriend had the ribs lunch special. Both were DELICIOUS! Seriously the best green curry I've had since being in Asia! Presentation of the food was awesome, the staff was attentive and polite and the restaurant was bustling! I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to Thai food lovers!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"Just thinking about writing this review, and looking through all the photos makes me crave this place. I love Thai food and this is my favourite spot in the city. The chicken pad Thai is so good it stops me from trying anything else. That being said, I have tried the cashew chicken and the spring rolls. Both were amazing, but usually I stick with the pad Thai. They have great lunch specials that comes with rice, and a spring roll at a great price -$10.50 (Lunch special served between 11:30am - 3pm). The space is large enough for big groups, and they have two different seating areas. If you decide take out is more your thing, the containers they give you are super sturdy (and reusable!) They have three locations, one in Halifax, one in Dartmouth and the last in Bedford. The Bedford location is closed Tuesday's btw."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"I had a major craving for thai food, and this place definitely satisfied it. I shared the red curry with chicken and the cashew chicken with my boyfriend, and both were very good (decent portion sizes too). I like my thai food spicy, and I appreciate that they really listened a gave me the extra bit of kick I asked for. As others have commented, I was also a bit surprised that they charge extra for rice (up to $6 for a large serving), especially when you are ordering multiple entree dishes. Aside from that, I enjoyed my meal and I will definitely be back."

Everyone was happy with their meals and food came out fairly quickly. Service was a bit slow to catch people who joined us later on, so you have to be pretty proactive in flagging down servers, or else people starve. Red curry chicken was excellent and the mango salad is a TREAT! Portions are reasonable and prices are too. Fun spot overall."

Waitress offered the hot sauce which turned out to be pretty good.Guess I'll be going back again!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"During the days before and after my birthday this year, there was much indulgence of both liquid and food forms. On my birthday itself, this is where I chose to go with my girlfriend to have some more of the latter.It was a Monday, so things were fairly quiet, with just a couple other tables being occupied in their mid-sized dining room. It's very open and welcoming with easy going greens and browns dominating the colour palette. We were quickly seated and after a quick glance at the drink menu, I ordered a Tsingtao beer while my other half stuck with pop.As with any restaurant of eastern Asian origins, the menu is pretty sizable. With sections for apps, soups, the various proteins, and a few other things, it takes some time to decide what you actually want. Eventually we settled on the intriguing sounding bird's nest appetizer, which comes with stir fried ground pork, onion, carrot, broccoli, red pepper, black mushroom and cilantro, all in a fried ""nest"" of noodles I assumed. For our mains we went with the Pad See Ew and basil chicken. I was tempted by their pad Thai, as I've heard great things, but the thing with pad Thai is that it's basically the pizza of Thai food - even a ""bad"" pad Thai is still pad Thai - so I wanted to branch out a bit and save the pad Thai for when I needed something familiar and dependable. After a short wait our plate of bird's nests came. Six wonderful looking cups of fried noodles with the pork filling and an artfully crafted carrot flower made this choice a winner before even having a bite. Once we dug in, we were glad that it was able to live up to the visual hype. There's a great mix of flavours from the pork and veggies and a good contrast of textures from the soft pork mixture and the crunchy nests. Since neither of us are big cilantro fans, we picked that garnish off and added the roasted basil leaves that decorated the plate. The six eye- and belly-pleasing nests seemed like a steal at $11.We were done our nests just in time to make room on the table for the mains. Pad See Ew was comprised of flat noodles like pad Thai, and a rich, slightly sweet sauce, chicken, fried egg, rapini, carrots and onion. It was a solid dish, with a nice balance of flavours, although I always wish that noodles weren't chopped up in these sorts of dishes. I guess that at heart, I'm just a kid who likes playing with his long noodles!The basil chicken was a good dish as well, although neither main really met the high bar set by our bird's nests. With slices of chicken, onions, large chunks of what seemed like fresh pineapple, chiles, garlic and basil, there's not much to not like in this dish. The sauce had a bit of heat from the chile's, just enough to make me sip my beer a bit more, but not to have me worried about my face being burnt off or post-digestion issues. The veggies were cooked to a perfect tender crisp, showing that the cooks aren't slacking off on a slow night. Prices were quite reasonable, with two mains, an app and drinks coming to just over $50 taxes in, with enough for leftovers for a very hearty meal for the next day. Timely, friendly service throughout the meal was an added bonus as well. I was glad to scratch another restaurant off my 'to eat at' list, and even more so that it turned out so well, and I look forward to stopping by for their pizza, er, pad Thai, one of these days."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"First time here - out of towner looking for some good Thai food. And that's what I got here. After trolling the web and seeing what pops up as good spots to try in Halifax, I'm glad that I came here. We started with the Mee Grob - a wonderful crispy noodle appetizer. It was so good I could eat that everyday - too bad I had to share with my table mates!We had the Massaman Curry with shrimp and the Pad Thai with shrimp for dinner. Both dishes were great! The Pad Thai was flavourful - the aromas from the spices and herbs were mouth watering and could smell my dish making its way to my table from the kitchen. The Massaman Curry was yummy - I've never had this before and I hope I can find it somewhere in my city. Perfect dish for a cold day!Yum! I wish they had this resto in my home city! I would be here all the time for lunch and dinner. Their prices were quite reasonable, which is a bonus!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/cha-baa-thai-halifax?hrid=ZrZ918MKaW0ouDrw-WjvVQ,Cha Baa Thai,"This is by far some of the best Thai food I've had. Not to toot my own horn, but Thai is definitely my favorite food and I've had a lot of it! This place is way up there with the best i've had, woohoo! We came here back in the summer and loveddd it.This place is a great place to take someone on a date in my humble opinion. The decor is adorable, cozy but stylish... And I mean, who doesn't like Thai food? I got the chicken satay and red chicken curry, my boyfriend got the cashew chicken and tofu satay. I also ordered a Thai iced tea. They seemed baffled at how to make a Thai iced tea, which tells me not a lot of people order it and that makes me sad. Halgonians, please order more of this tasty beverage, you'll thank me for it. However, the only negative of Cha Baa Thai is that the iced tea was not made right. I'm not sure what this kind of tea was but it was nice either way, it had coconut and lime in it. Thai iced tea usually has evaporated milk, cold tea and lime in it. Thai Ivory is the place to go for good Thai iced tea, FYI. Don't get me wrong, it was still really nice just not what I was expecting.The satay chicken skewers were amazing. The peanut sauce was to die for and the chicken was so tender and well seasoned. My boyfriend's tofu satay skewers were equally as good. The mains were just as good as the apps. My curry was spicy without being overwhelming, it was flavourful, and the perfect consistency. I hate watery red curry! I could have easily licked the plate but I restrained myself. My boyfriend's cashew tofu was amazing too. The tofu wasn't mushy or watery and it was so flavorful! And it too had the perfect amount of spice. I'm moving back to Halifax in April and I look forward to becoming a regular here :)"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,I take everyone who visits to this great little gem on Dresden Row. Whether for lunch or dinner I have not had one complaint about a meal at this place. I've been dining here since it opened in 2014 and the quality of the food and service has remained consistent. That's probably because the chef and front of house has not changed (they're the owners too!).I could recommend so many things off the menu (I've tried most of it) but my favorite is the pistachio kebab. I've never see anything like it at any other Mediterranean style restaurants.Also the soup is the best lentil soup I've ever tasted (maybe one of the best soup's ever).This is one of Halifax's best kept secrets.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,AMAZING Staff!!!!! I go here for lunch at least once a week. As soon as i call they know my order. the food is so flavorful. I get the Chicken kabob(chicken well done) lunch special. The lunch portion is NOT small so I always have left overs :). If you have a chance to check out this hidden gem. I highly suggest you do
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"I stopped into Efendy for my brothers birthday early December and was very pleasantly surprised. Having wandered past this place many time I had always wanted to go in and give it a go. Walking in through the front door the first thing I noticed was the lovely atmosphere, far more welcoming then I expected. My first interaction was with a wonderfully pleasant waiter who expertly kept the balance of being attentive, yet not too intrusive. This can be a very rare quality indeed and it was done flawlessly. I had a starter plate that was filled with a mix of delicious samples and so much pita bread. By the time my main course arrived I was starting to get filled but had to keep on eating. The flavour was fantastic and as much as I wanted to I couldn't finish. Which was totally ok because it allowed for me to bring home enough for a full meal at home. The prices are very good for the atmosphere, service and quality/quantity of the food. This is one of those places that I can't wait to go back and try a new dish. A must go for people who enjoy trying something different. Sit back, don't rush and indulge in the flavour that is Efendy."

Super friendly, quick, and attentive. We ordered the baba-ganoush starter which was creamy and delicious (they smoked the eggplant), I had the moussaka, which was to. die. for. I can't remember what my companions ordered as I was too blown away by my own plate. Suffice it to say, they were also gushing about their choice. This place is a gem and is now on my list of must-go while in Halifax."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"Are you a vegetarian with a passion for Turkish and Mediterranean cuisine? Then come on down to Efendy for some delicious food. Seriously though, the food here is really good and the vegetarian platter is huge. If you're new to either vegetarianism or Mediterranean food, this is a great introduction. ...Probably not to both simultaneously though. I recognize that $17 may seem like a lot based on the limited description in the menu but trust me, you will not be disappointed. Service here has always been good. Servers are relaxed and comfortable while still attentive. I've never eaten on the patio (though it seems lovely) but I can attest the dining area is quite pleasant. I've never been here when it's very busy but it does seem like the kind of place that would be quite noisy if it were full.Writing this review has reminded me that I haven't been in a while. And that I've never had the desserts here (too full from my main!)."

I had never heard of the place before and had my reservations about going as I expected to be paying an arm and a leg. I was pleasantly surprised.The restaurant is cozy, there aren't many tables and it was quite quiet. It was very easy to have a conversation and enjoy our meal.My wife decided on the chicken kofte kebab and absolutely loved it! I went with a chicken kebab, it was also very good. The portions were quite generous. We each tried an appetizer, the calamari was cooked perfectly and the cheese borek was very tasty!I will say, though, that I was not near as impressed with the baklava. I have had much better baklava elsewhere. Surprisingly, I was slightly disappointed with the Turkish coffee. That being said, I was craving a Turkish coffee so bad that I was probably going to be disappointed by any. I will reserve judgement on the Turkish coffee for the next visit.I can't wait to go back. Next time I will have to remember to try the raki."

The owner was our server and very friendly and helpful with menu questions,it was a wonderful experience.

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"When you're located in the former location of Fid, a local culinary titan that was in the vanguard of local food with a modern touch, you've got some hefty shoes to fill. Luckily, Efendy is quite different, being a Turkish/Mediterranean restaurant and avoids many of the direct comparisons that would arise if it were anything close to being similar to Fid. Not a whole lot has changed on the interior; the lovely brick wall and opposing red one with a chalkboard-paint section could be any type of cozy restaurant. However, Efendy has added a large charcoal grill to the window by the kitchen and opened up that area a bit as well.After being seated and grabbing some drinks, my girlfriend and I chose the cheese borek to start - phyllo pastry filled with feta cheese and herbs. I think the ubiquity of cheese-filled pastries across so many cultures just speaks to that being a dish that is universally recognized as being awesome and Efendy's version certainly upholds that tradition. Both the phyllo and the filling are great, and the thick dill yogurt dip adds even more creamy flavour to each flaky bite. A small salad it was plated with helped cut through some of the richness, although I do wish there were more than three pieces of borek. For my main I ordered the yogurt kebab plate which comes with their adana kofte kebab (minced lamb), yogurt and tomato sauce, rice, pita and salad. The lamb was pretty good, moist and with a nice lamb flavour without being gamey. However, as koftes often are, it was a little on the chewy side, but it wasn't too bad. The yogurt added some tanginess to balance the kebab, but the tomato sauce wasn't particularly unique and mostly tasted like tomato paste. The pitas were thick but airy, with a pleasant chew to them, and were good for dipping in the sauces. The jasmine rice was nice and buttery, so naturally it was good. The salad had a refreshing mix of cucumber, tomato, green pepper, red onion, and splash of oil and parsley. All in all, a decent plate.The falafel wrap that my girlfriend had was a big winner, with her exclaiming that it was possibly the best she's ever had. The falafels had a crisp shell with moist filling , and a noticeable green tint from added herbs. Wrapped in a tasty pita, and with a salad on the side, this was a steal a $8.50 (now marginally more).Service was friendly and attentive throughout our meal.With good food at reasonable prices in such a warm atmosphere, Efendy is a very well-rounded restaurant and I hope they can stick it out in the crowded Mediterranean scene in Halifax."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"Absolutely amazing food. Quite possibly one of my favorite places to eat in the city. The price is justified by the taste, an explosion of flavor in your mouth. Closest thing to eating in Istanbul in Halifax. The portions aren't massive to make you bloated, the perfect amount. My favorite thing was they didn't ask how the meal was half way. Highly recommend."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"I had seen other reviewers recommending Effendy and since we live nearby, we decided to get some takeout for dinner tonight. We ended up ordering the 6 Course Set Meal, and chose Falafel as our hot starter and baklava as our dessert (everything else is selected for you). The falafel was by far the best we had ever had. It was incredibly crispy on the outside but lots of parsley made it taste fresh and not too heavy. It came with hummus and a fresh tomato condiment that was an incredible compliment to the creamy chickpeas. The mezze plate came with a bunch of cold starters. If you ate in (rather than take out) I am sure they would tell you what all of them are but what was important was that all of them were delicious. The one I could not get enough of was the beet puree. It sounds simple and unassuming on the menu but it tastes incredible -sweet and tangy and fresh. The baba ghanoush is also worth mentioning -it was my husband's favourite -lightly smokey and deliciously creamy. The mixed kebab was tasty too-especially the lamb. I love lamb, and this was beautiful, flavorful and cooked just how I like it (which for me, means not overdone). Unless you want a really huge amount of food, the 6 course set meal was definitely enough food for two, and a really reasonable price for all of the tasty things we got to try! It was a great way to experience this restaurant for the first time and we will definitely be back!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,Loved it.. Tasty food in big portions very friendly and lovely people.. The only thing I didn't like is the lack of parking spots
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"I came here for lunch on a nice warm day and chose to sit outside. I got the Lamb Shish Kebab lunch special and doubted the small portion at first but after I ate everything I felt full and light, it was quite satisfying. I didn't like the sauces that had come with the dish but not to worry the lamb itself was delicious! I found that the salad on the side perfectly balanced out the smokiness of the meat. It was good for the price of $10.99."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/efendy-turkish-and-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=0b8s7mHCN8b3Tk6zCYPhtg,Efendy Turkish & Mediterranean Grill,"After hearing that the guy who brought you the delicious lunches at Kebab Kitchen was opening his own spot, we had to try. Upon walking in, the smells are amazing, the interior is gorgeous and cozy, and the lighting is beautiful. Being offered a spot by the window, we gladly took it. We love Turkish cuisine so we immediately knew we wanted so many of the appetizers, and we were very happy to see they had a mezze plate option for only $8.50. It was the perfect portion size, we a bit of everything: hummus, dill sauce, the red sauce, pita, helloumi, peppers, olives, feta, grape leaves, and lentils. It was delish. We also ordered a 1/2lt of house wine, and were extremely pleased by the presentation in a gorgeous glass jug and a price of only $13. It was a great deal.Then we moved on to the mains, both R. and I opting for a seafood option, as we know they get it fresh in every week. I got the seafood that is stewed in tomatoes and spices, which came with their amazing rice and turkish salad. And R. got the seafood kebab which comes with the same sides. Great portions! entrees all hovered around the $15 which is more than reasonable for what you get. All very delicious. Their white dill sauce is LITERALLY to die for. So amazing. Best part of this place is the owner/cook. He is friendly smiling from the back where you can watch him cook over a charcoal grill. All very clean and gets your mouth watering for your meal. Although small, it really doesn't feel small, they have laid out the place perfectly. This will definitely be my new favorite place. Much better than some of the other Hali Turkish spots!"

Guest service is quite important, especially being a manager in retail. From service to food, we definitely will be back!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,"Went there last night ordered their Tenderloin - was very disappointed when it came! Ordered medium rare came out completely rare ate half and very poorly seasoned, full of salt - the veg was very under cooked as well, at maybe 1/4. When the server came I explained the food asking if this was normal, she said no and it looked rare and she'd tell the chef I never expect compensation just an understanding or maybe a free coffee - she never said a thing I was given bill which I paid with full gratuity. Needless to say I will never come back and would not recommend this place if you want a good meal."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,"Actually, we planed to find a place for drinks. However, we walked by Primal Kitchen and while my friend was looking at their drink menu, I checked Eat menu. I was so happy that they have game meats. Then, we decided to try their dinner instead. We shared one Board of Three ($19, you can choose three kinds of meat or cheese) and Frog Legs for our appetizers. We chose beef, bison and ostrich for the board. We loved beef and ostrich. Bison was not that good. Frog Legs was surprised us. They tasted sooo good. There were some crispy stuffs, mango and flavored carrots on the top. Frog legs were in the middle, and the bottom was a pancake. To be honest, we thought it's strange to have frog legs and pancake in the same dish. After we had them, we changed our mind lolOk, then we had our main dish. Me had lamb (rare). tender and yummy. My friend had duck but it was overcooked. :(At the end, I ordered Maval and she had Sorbet for desserts. Both were great."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,"After I heard that Fiasco was getting re-done as a meat and craft beer place, I had to check it out. More financially accessible, plus a carnivorous focus? Yes, please.The interior is fairly laid back with re-purposed wood on the walls and the requisite Edison-style bulbs with the exposed filaments. A pillar inscribed with the impressively lengthy proocess for their short rib is a nice touch. It isn't a big space, but it's relaxed and warmer than its predecessor.There's some interesting options on the menu, which is of course very protein heavy. Non-traditional restaurant foods such as trout, venison, pork cheek and wild boar all make appearances. A charcuterie board with options like goose, bison and rabbit? That's here too.We got an order of the seafood wontons and calamari to start, and I got the duck confit for my main. Many of the aforementioned meats were tempting, but I love me some duck and thought a dish I was familiar with would be a better gauge of their kitchen.To get things started, we were served a small bowl of the house kettle chips. They were fantastic - crispy and a great flavour with just a bit of heat, these didn't last long.Our won tons were served in a way I wasn't expecting - open-faced instead of neat little bundles. So really they were Chinese nachos, which I'm fine with. There were six chips, two for each type of meat - lobster, shrimp and scallop. All three were cooked perfectly, or in the case of the scallop not at all. The chopped shrimp was some of the most tender I've ever had. A great appetizer.The calamari was a generous portion, with lots of lightly battered and fried rings that were tossed in a lightly spicy red sauce. I'm not a calamari expert, but the doneness seemed to be good, but not mind blowingly tender.A drumstick and thigh of duck came topped with a fried egg, Lyonnaise potatoes cooked in duck fat, lardons and red currant jus. Sumply put, it was amazing. The meat was extremely tender and moist, and the flavour of the duck itself wasn't overpowered by the other ingredients. It was definitely one of the best duck dishes I've ever had. The runny yolk of the egg made for a great sauce, as it always does, and the lardons' rich flavour and saltiness fit in perfectly with the rest of the dish.The few bites I had of my friend's short rib were extremely good as well. First of all, it's a monstrous dish with the big rib bone and large hunk of meat that's attached to it. Some places can be oddly cheap with their short rib, but not here. The meat had a great beef flavour and flaked away easily with just a fork.I shared a creme brulee with my wife for dessert. The sugar on top hadn't fully hardened when we got it, so it was an awkwardly malleable hunk of sugar, although the cream below was rich, fluffy and delicious.Our server was a holdover from the pre-rebranding days of Fiasco and said that business was up significantly from before, which was good to hear, as I'm glad to have Primal in my line up of places in Halifax for a top notch bite to eat and beer to drink."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,Great spot with a nice ambience. My friend and I each got the burger but everything on the menu looked delicious. We loved the complimentary kettle chips that came with our drinks. This is a place I'll have to try out late on a weekend night and get a charcuterie plate.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,"I placed a reservation for 2, window or booth, for last Friday in the morning . We were told not a problem, seats reserved for 6:30pm.We arrived at 6:30pm sharp, I stated I had a reservation for a window or booth for 2 at 6:30, and then were sat in the middle of the restaurant without a word explaining why our seats were given away. Two couples had JUST been sat down, not even 5 minutes, before us at the only window seats, and proceeded to get there first drink order in sync with us. For the reservation snub, I take off a star.The restaurant has a cool look, I liked the atmosphere, the paintings, and about 95% of the music that played in the background. It was a tad noisy as its a small space and began to fill up the longer we stayed. Next, we are asked if we would like drinks. My girlfriend gets a glass of white, and I asked the server, of the draft beer, how is the stout? ""It's a stout"" and a shrug I get in response. I should have clued in that this means this server knows nothing about beer, but I gave Waiter Jason a chance. I then clarified and said I was looking for the least hoppy beer on the draft menu. He came back with what was suppose to be the red, my receipt says its IPA, but regardless it tasted like pure soapy hops. Clearly, the man should have just stated he didn't know about the beer and asked the bartender, but instead served me whole hops in a glass. After suffering through the beer, he asked if I'd like another. I asked for a small taste splash of the Stout. There was no noticeable hops - it was a very balanced tasting beer. Down goes another star.Now, the food is where this place wins. The calamari was great, didn't come with enough of the curry mayo dip, but was cooked just right and had excellent batter coating. The house salad with chick peas and bacon was also great, really good dressing. We had the short rib and tenderloin for mains, aside for the excess fat on the short rib, both were great. The tenderloin I had was cooked perfectly. The food really stood out here and saved this place from the poor dining experience and lack of hospitality knowledge.Overall, dinner for 2 with alcoholic beverage and apps was 150$ with tip. A tad steep, I'd probably recommend somewhere else for a nice dinner date."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,Went to Primal on Saturday night with a large group of friends. None of us had been there before and we were all impressed. The ambiance was comfortable and the food was delicious. I had the duck confit which was very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food and agreed that although the portions were smallish they were very satisfying. Our server Kate was excellent. Service was prompt and her wit kept the table amused.Our meals weren't cheap but the food was excellent and everyone thought that the bill was fair. If you are looking to stuff your belly for cheap this might not be the place for you but if you prefer quality over quantity you won't be disappointed with Primal.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/primal-kitchen-halifax?hrid=zrrrWYC2TEZ7DiKNRCnj_w,Primal Kitchen,"I have been to Primal Kitchen twice now and have enjoyed both times. The first time was in October for my Birthday- there were 10 of us. Everyone loved their meals! Great service, great wine selection, and lots of local craft beers! I love the decor, the menu, everything! The second time visited was Thursday, January 7th, again with a group (7). Overall, we had a nice time, but there were a few issues. Some of us ordered starters, followed by mains, while others ordered 2 dishes as their main meal. I requested to have the Tuna Tartar first, followed by the Chicken. My tuna didn't come out with the rest of the starters, so I let the waitress know that I hadn't received it. Her response was that she thought I would want my 2 dishes at once since the rest of the ladies at the table were having theirs at once. I specifically requested to have the tuna first. As a server of 10 years, I know that the 'customer is always right'- No matter if the customer is mistaken or not- apologize for the mix up and let them know it will be remedied right away. Others around me confirmed I had requested for the tuna to come first. Had she been more pleasant about the mix up, it really would not have bothered me-mistakes happen. Overall she was not friendly, and this was the general consensus. We are a laid back group who dine out often, and we are normally generous tippers. I only tipped 15% (not my norm) as did others because the server was just not friendly and seemed to not want to be there. I was not thanked upon paying my bill either.A comment on the food- everything was delicious: our group enjoyed the tuna, squid, tart, oysters, burger, lamb, and more! However, 6 of us had the bang bang chicken because we all had a bite of someone's back in October that was delicious, but it didn't live up to what we remembered. The flavours were amazing, but the chicken was so tough, our jaws were actually tired from chewing. I wouldn't order it again, but I will definitely be back to try more dishes."

Everything is customizable to your tastes and you decide what goes on your food - so if you don't like it, it's you're own darn fault. ;)The service is impeccable - the staff are so friendly and chatty. The burrito masters really seem to enjoy themselves and they love to joke around with their customers. It made the experience all that more enjoyable."

It's so convenient, I wish I had noticed this location sooner. I first tried Habaneros at the Dartmouth restaurant, so I was over the moon to find this one so close to home. I've never had a burrito this good. You build it with your favourite toppings, so no matter what, it's going to be great. It's so delicious (and quick) that going here crosses my mind at least once a day. I always have very friendly and fast service at both locations too! Those burrito artist know what their doing!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"Tacos!!!I'd give it 4.5/5 as it's pricey for tacos, but not so much for a full star off. And since Yelp doesn't do 1/2 stars, I'll round up because TACOS!I had tried the Dartmouth location before, but this was my first foray at this one. Just as good! Took my sister here for lunch today and we both had 3 tacos (1 beef, 1 chicken, 1 pork), and combo tortilla chips and fountain pop is about $15 after tax and tip. The tacos were great, and the homemade chips were fantastic too. The decorations inside were pretty fun too (giant LED lizards). The place was empty at 2pm when I went, which at first was a little concerning but made sense for the late lunch. A few others strolled in shortly after.It really hit the spot!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"I think it's quite satisfying. Food was tasty, and it was cheap as well. I had a veggie burrito. The sauce was very delicious (I chose mango sauce). The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because I feel the tables there do need a wipe. Other than that, it's perfect."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"Picked-up the jerked chicken special as a burrito bowl for lunch today. The server confirmed it was made as a small burrito bowl, that was fine. I was surprised that instead of charging the usual $6.59 for a small burrito bowl I paid $9.95. That's more than a large burrito bowl. What's up with that? A large burrito bowl is a heck of a lot of food, this wasn't a heck of a lot of food. Some different flavors, sure but I would have been better-off with a large chicken burrito bowl and still paid less."

I get the burrito bowl and load the spice.. The pork is my favorite but have tried the chicken, taco and barboca. The sitting area is vibrant and there's a nice selection of different Tabasco sauces on every table. If you're in the mood for something fresh, delicious and spicy... This is it."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,I lived in Texas for 4 yeas....so I acquired a taco/burritto/burrito bowl etc regular craving. Since moving back to halifax I have tried 3 other taco/burrito spots...They all sucked. Habaneros has done a great job coming close to perfect. Best taco place in Halifax by far.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"Omg, the food is as fresh and tasty as it gets! I love that you can pick and choose your toppings and customize your order to suit dietary restrictions and preferences. I always get the burrito salad bowl, and skip the tortilla shell (and the rice, and the beans). I don't feel ""ripped off"" even though I leave those items off, because the remaining portion is plentiful and all the toppings more than compensate. Delicious!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"Stopped by yesterday evening for a burrito. I hide chicken with the works (minus jalapeños, of which there were 3 varieties) and topped it off with cilantro lime rice and mango sour cream. Need I say more. The best burrito I've had in town, the first time I've been able to say that since having burrito jax. I highly recommend this place. I'll be going back soon for the tacos!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"I love the burritos but today I decided to expand my lunch horizons and go for the vegetarian burrito bowl. My dear high mistress of all that is spicy and delightful! The burrito bowl was a perfect combination of lentils, chickpeas and sweet potato in a Bombay curry sauce. The wonderful young man behind the counter helped me pick the right combination of vegetables and sauces, quickly steering me away from any of the pickled items as he said the briny juice would change the flavour of the curry. I definitely appreciated the direction. I was thrilled with the burrito bowl, I think I even like it more than the burrito. My only complaint is that the tortilla bowl was deep fried which left it a bit oily. If you're looking for a huge hearty bang for your buck, this is your dive!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"This food is ridiculously good. Everything is fresh and as much as possible is local. Not only do they have delicious offerings, they also have people who are well trained to make the best flavour-pairing choices possible.I had a burrito bowl for a work event and was very sad that I eventually got full enough that I could not possibly eat any more. :)I am planning to go out for an anniversary dinner soon and had planned to go somewhere else but since eating at Habaneros I absolutely intend to scrap those plans and bring my husband to Habaneros instead!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"Went there on 17th September and ordered a chicken burrito with extra meat. The Asian girl behind the counter was very friendly and had a nice personality. Really liked her attitude. The burrito was huge, I had two meals with that. Mexican food is one of my favourites and I usually do not eat Mexican food in Canada as I have been to some of the mom and pop Mexican places throughout USA. However I thought the food has nice flavour here and I will keep going back."

Beat Jax by a ton :D I first went to Habaneros in Woodside, and was so happy to see them move in closer to me on South Park Street. The burritos cram in all the lovely goodness of beans, salsa and meat. But be warned, i went in here on a warm day and was overcome with the heat of the place :S I guess it isn't very well ventilated. So i think that would be the only complaint. Otherwise CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. So delish!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/habaneros-modern-taco-bar-halifax-2?hrid=MSnQRjXkO-SG3HPO2QtFYA,Habaneros Modern Taco Bar,"A very pleasant addition to my lunch circuit.The burritos are solid and cheap, and the 3 taco deal is amazing. The pulled pork ones are fantastic, and a really good array of toppings. (these are the same guys who run the gecko bus that parks outside of Kent I think). They usually have a feature plate if you want something different. (For xmas the other day they had turkey quesadillas. Last month it was mexican jambalaya)One catch, they only prepare one at a time. If someone in front of you is ordering for their office, forget it. You might as well go next door and get a Vietnamese sandwich. I hope the owners see the mistake to have such a small prep bar in a location with so much space. Take a chapter from Subway and get a bit of an assembly line going.Add a shorter lineup to the mix and this place will become an institution in a few years."

There was a live jazz pianist/vocalist but she was far from overwhelming. I've been during daylight hours, but the night atmosphere is far superior.The 5 star is primarily based on the service and the value. The service was exceptional. Friendly, prompt, and courteous.The food was very good, and very reasonable. For 4 adults and a child, with a round of drinks, apps, mains, and desert it was only $150, and it wasn't bad. Everyone had a lovely night and left very happy. I'd recommend it to couples and older groups. The crowd skews 40+ for sure."

Only because I had a CoastMart coupon that I tried to use on the weekend during brunch but the server politely pointed out that it cannot be used for brunch. NBD, I'll just come back, which I did, last night!Monday nights usually don't lend themselves to be a busy night for eating out but you can tell LBBL was trying to entice people with their Monday special (Free app or lemon pie dessert with entree); pretty good deal I'd say. Either way, I got the bistro burger (sub salad instead of fries, but the size of the salad was a bit disappointing) and my friend got the bistro burger. Server was very pleasant and it was actually the same person that served me brunch over the weekend. Ha.I know some people think LBBL tries too hard with their French ambiance, but I love it. It's nice to switch it up from the usual Maritime/East Coast theme with the same usual decor, etc. etc. And the french music in the background is awesome. Food came out hot and delicious and they even were able to accommodate my lettuce for bun request (it's amazing to me how many kitchens won't do that). I wasn't expecting the lemon pie because I got a sandwich meal instead of a $20+ entree, but it was a pleasant surprise and I devoured every last bit of that carby goodness.Service was a bit slow near the end, but it worked out for us since we had to lounge around till 7 anyways."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,"The worst brunch experience I've had in Halifax to date.We joined a group of our friends at Bistro By Liz this morning for a celebration and because we were a larger group (15 people) they provided a set menu.I have quite a few food sensitivities and there was nothing on their set menu that I could eat. In hopes that I wouldn't cause too much upset or make it difficult on their kitchen, I requested 2 medium poached eggs and a side salad with no dressing. Simple enough, right? Wrong. The manager told me that, ""they normally don't do special orders for large groups because it slows down their kitchen and throws off everyone else's meals from being made on time."" I was shocked she told me this and was about to say never mind I will pass on brunch but she followed it with, ""but it's fine, I'll let them know."" My plate came out and had about 1/2 a cup of mixed greens on it, 1 slice of tomato, and 2 hard poaches eggs sitting in water. I ate the salad and wasn't going to say anything about the eggs but my fiancé realized that everyone else who ordered the same meal as him got bacon on their plate, but he did not. He mentioned it to the server and also mentioned that my eggs were overdone and without an apology or explanation, our server said ""I'll get that for you."" Her attitude and the attitude of the manager was almost worse than the experience we had with the food. She came back about 5 minutes later with a plate of bacon for my fiancé and 2 more poached eggs for me. I could tell just by looking at them that they were underdone. I broke them open and they were almost raw... She never came back to ask how they were so when she was clearing the plates I mentioned that they were way underdone. She took my plate and said, ""I'll take it off of your bill then."" No apology again. When we received our bill, I was shocked to see that they had charged me $6.95 for a half a cup of mixed greens. (Side note: I did not even get dressing on this ""salad."") Overall, the service was terrible, the food was terrible and I will not be back. I would have mentioned this at the restaurant if we weren't there to celebrate with our friends."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,"Stopped here for brunch (I know I have a problem with brunch but booze and bacon is just too good a combo to pass up) and what a treat. The place was packed but we were still seated quickly and the hostess was very friendly. Fantastic food and quick service I really enjoyed how the brunch menu also included either a caesar, mimosa, or coffee in the price of the meal. Food quality was excellent and very good price I will be back!"

They were happy to fix it and gave me a fresh meal rather than just replacing the item that was wrong. The food was good. I have yet to eat there so I have no comment on the table service. I'll post again once I do.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,"Our usual food crew dropped in here finally. My wife is not fond of French food so it took us a while to try out this place. The atmosphere was quite cute. The music and the indoor patio feel was charming. French onion soup and charcuterie board were very nice. Overall, the food was very tasty. However they were very salty. I think their ingredients were fresh enough to not have to mask so much with salt. Maybe it was just one off day..I will visit again with high hopes again"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,"Great spot. The first thing that I noticed about Le Bistro was the beautiful atmosphere. They clearly took their time thinking up the decor for this place, it had a relaxing ambience and had a definite French feel. Me and my mom, who had mobility issues were greeted by a really sweet hostess who went out of her way to make sure my mom was in a spot that would be easy to get in and out of. Our server was excellent and attentitive as well. Me and mom both settled on the French onion soup as an appetizer, my mom got the beef bourguignon and I got the papparatelle carbonara. The French onion soups were both phenomenal, up there with the best I've had, lots of cheese, a nice broth, seasoned nicely. Perfect. We were both more than satisfied. Next we got our mains. The beef bourguinon was served with mashed potatoes, my mom gave me a try and it was just like, the perfect French meal. It had a really nice strong wine flavor to it, and the meat was extremely tender, the preparation of that dish is definitely not rushed and you can taste it!The papparatelle was interesting. I've never had carbonara that tasted like this before but i didn't mind. it was a really interesting, meaty taste. I thought carbonara was an Italian dish but I felt like this dish had a neat French twist on it (caramelized onions, and it also had a sauce on it which reminded me of an au jus sauce). It was interesting. i felt it was a bit rich for me though and had to stop at about half and give it to mom. I'd love to come back and try some of their other amazing sounding dishes."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,Went for lunch with my friend last week. We both ordered to french onion soup as our appetizer. Both of us were quite disappointed as the soup was very bland. I think the cheese they used was mozzerella. There was just a small blob of cheese on the top. The broth was nice and clear but almost tasteless. The spoons we were given to eat the soup with were not clean. They still had bits of food on them. We asked for clean spoons and they were replaced but there was no apology or embarrassment on the part of the waitress. It was almost like this happens all the time. We split a pizza after the soup and it was okay. It also was quite bland but the crust was thin and crispy. Their wine by the bottle prices were reasonable compared with other restaurants. Out waitress was not very friendly and when she asked how our food was we were honest about how we felt. After that she was even less friendly! Bottom line is food was bland and expensive for what they served and the customer service was not good! Will not be returning.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,"I had been wanting to go here forever. I always walk by this place and notice the cute red and white checkered table cloths and tell myself I have to try this place!So 2 years later I finally did. My overall experience was just okay. The atmosphere was nicely decorated and well-kept to make it seem like you were outside (the revealing glass to let the sun shine through and the trees).. but it's not quite the same feeling as sitting outside. Nice try.They had a lady playing piano and singing lovely music.. but for a Friday night there was maybe 3 tables at about 8PM. I felt really bad for her - she was talented and the resto was dead... even on a Fri night.My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer and our individual meals. For the appetizer, we had the snails... which were okay. They were smothered in cheese and you could have replaced the snails for mushrooms and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. For our individual meals, we had the two most expensive entrees: lamb shank and steak (which were actually quite inexpensive - $22 and $26). Although they were good, we've had better and would have paid a few extra dollars elsewhere to have enjoyed amazing food with a lively atmosphere."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-bistro-by-liz-halifax?hrid=0B-0QMKMRcTGICb64VB5Vw,Le Bistro By Liz,"Le Bistro by Liz is so, so nice! The atmosphere made me wish I was on a romantic date (instead of an office party!). I'm usually not a fan of eating in a dark setting - but the entire mood that the décor Le Bistro offers is undeniably enjoyable. It's funky - cozy - classy.Our server was fantastic. He had great energy and was super personable and attentive. He made us laugh quite a few times - I love when servers do that! The food isn't the only reason we enjoy eating out so much.The menu was small but had a lot of different options and was very appropriately priced; ranging from $7 to $22. We ordered quite a bit. There are two types of mussels, spicy marinara and classic Chablis sauce, we had the Chablis. It was very flavourful. But, not as flavourful as the escargot; with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers, and goat cheese - I couldn't stop cleaning up the excess sauce with my bread! It was so good, I would go back just for that. We also had an order of potato skins; they were good, but nothing special.For my main dish I had the ""Scallops a La Bordelaise"". There was about 5 large Digby scallops with whole wheat fettuccini and chardonnay sauce. It was good - but a little boring; needed a kick to it. Some people in my party ordered the ""Club Paris"" - a chicken club sandwich served on pretzel bread - it looked really good! Everyone enjoyed their meal - there were absolutely no complaints! I'm not sure how I had room for dessert, but I did. My friend and I spilt their ""famous yummy lemon parfait pie"". It was not what I expected; but it was delicious.I would return here over and over again. It has such a great space. The only negative is their bathroom only has one stall. They were hosting a few holiday parties that night and long washroom waits are not fun!Bonus: I called to check if they take reservations, they did! And, it was for a Friday night! I was super impressed by this as usually restaraunts won't on weekends."

However I would stick to simple items. For example croque monsieur = delicious. Calamari = greasy rubber tubes. The complimentary bread was terribly dry. I mean thanks for the free bread but no thanks the dry mouth!Atmosphere = (1/1 star) Feels like your sitting somewhere in Paris. Nice and bright. Relaxing Service (.5/1 star) Off and on.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating, with the outdoor seating being upstairs on the roof. If you're lucky you can get a table with a nice street view. The atmosphere can get very festive, especially on weekends, and it can be quite a crush of people to deal with during peak times. It can be well worth it though since the staff are friendly, there are great food and drink specials, and the overall quality of the food is good as well. Last time I was there I had some sort of quinoa bowl that was absolutely delicious."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"Like most Haligonians, I have been to YFM many times over the years. But I lived away for several years and just got back here again for a visit on a recent overcast, mild Monday in October around 5pm. There are dozens of tables & booths inside, plus famous rooftop patio, so the place can hold many dozens of people I would guess. Live music on the weekends. Friendly service. Simple but clean and decent décor with a large bar, lower lighting and a cozy feel, for such a big place. Decent nachos ( topped with red, green and jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and a blend of three cheeses, served with salsa and sour cream. Don't see the prices on their online menu?) I found them a bit better than average because the cheese stayed stretchy instead of getting hard and dry like most places, even though that meant the chips at the bottom were soggy by the time I got to them, I rather this than the alternative. My partner tried their daily special of the Blackened Chicken Tacos ( lots of white chicken breast strips with a chipotle sauce and some veggies in a red crunchy tortilla shell, then wrapped in a white soft tortilla, for a fun texture variety and to keep it from spilling all over the place). He was happy with it. Basically, there's nothing extraordinary about this place, but safe to say you'll have an enjoyable, simple experience, enhanced of course with a drink or three. I'd say the only genuine concern I may have is that I don't see an elevator anywhere, so anyone with accessibility issues would not be able to get up the long flight of stairs to get in.May 2016 sunny Tuesday evening visit: The place was quite busy. Tried the Truffle Fries (Golden brown potato wedges, seasoned with truffle oil and topped with green onion and parmesan cheese. Served with a garlic aioli.) were ok - slightly overdone but not bad enough to complain, yet I think were $8, 9 or 10 in price? Again, there are no prices on the online menu that I can see. I wouldn't get them again. Wine bottles were a good price though, so I'd go back just for drinks anytime. Service was friendly.May 2016 overcast Saturday for brunch around 10? Very quiet and we had our choice of almost any table. Pretty good Eggs benny with thin ham slices instead of thick backbacon, and Eggs Florentine. The Hollandaise was a bit bland, as I like mine buttery and rich, but was ok. The home fries were good."

Vic ordered Mustache Burger. A whopper! Beer and coffee. Good too. Hit the spot. Friendly and efficient staff. They told us to look at the mural in men's room. Wonderful murals all around.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"YFM is a decent restaurant but it's never my first choice of when deciding on going out to eat. There seating can be a little confusing, they say you can sit where you like, but the window seating is reserved (or preferred) for those over 19 because they serve alcoholic drinks but there is no seating sign telling you that, so if you don't have ID or are a minor (they have a kids menu), you will be asked to set somewhere else.they have good food, but nothing unique, burgers, fries, pasta and salads."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"After trying the bar downstairs I ended up here for dinner and drinks. This is a super cool place for both eating and drinking with a fun atmosphere. I sat at the bar and had good service and was able to watch a game. The beer selection was good and I was able to try a few local beers that I have never had. The food menu is large with pretty much anything you could want. The artichoke dip I ordered was tasty and way to large for me to finish. The restaurant is large with plenty of bar and table seating. It seemed to have a good crowd, nothing too crazy but still a fun time. I would come back here for a meal or for a drink if I am ever in the area again."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"I am so disappointed leaving this establishment. The two stars are for the atmosphere, semi good service, and my campions fish taco dinner. My meal on the other hand was far from good. I had the grilled meatloaf with a side of French onion soup. The meatloaf and gravy on top were season less and just tasted of grill/char and the soup was delivered lukewarm with minimal onions and the base tasted like unreduced alcohol. This establishment must only be good for their selection of drinks...once you've had a few everything must taste good. I could go on about other minuet details but the biggest disappointment and what other customers would be worried about, is the quality of the food. I don't see myself giving this place a second chance."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"Let's start with the positive the atmosphere is good and the service was excellent! My finance and I were seated quickly and the table was clean the waitress was also cheerful and attentive. Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering the eggs benny which is the reason for the 2 stars it's one of the worst I've had in Halifax. The first time it came out the English muffin was cold, it hadn't been toasted and there was no butter it was ""raw."" My eggs were also raw, the yolks were runny as I had requested but the rest of the egg whites were also very runny. The waitress was very good when I sent it back and a replacement came promptly but they are trying to pass off an odd tasting béchamel as hollandaise sauce and the overall effect is not appetizing. Overall not a good place for brunch."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,Had lunch yesterday at YFM. I ordered the pub club with spinach salad. This is still one of the best clubs in the city. It's not the same as all the other clubs out there - go try it. The salad was ok -- needs more dressing or something. Great servers and the management are always around. Great spot!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"Great place!Nice atmosphere, great drinks and food. Important to know: every Tuesday - steak night. Every Thursday - chicken wings night!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"I have been here twice, neither time was really great. I am all for live music and I really love but we went around 5 pm on a friday and the music was so loud I couldnt even hear my friends and or the waitress. The waitresses are not all that friendly either, we got one drink and she asked if we wanted a second and we said no, she looked at us puzzled.The food was mediocre, we ordered an appetizer platter that included mozza sticks, chicken strips and potato skins. There was 2 mozza sticks, a ton of chicken strips and the potato skins were all stuck to the bottom of the basket we couldnt even get them off without ruining them it was definitely a big waste of money. For such a popular restaurant you would think the service would have been better but it was terrible, the waitresses also have this attitude that they dont need to work hard, hopefully this review and the countless other bad ones will spark something in them for a change because I would like to enjoy this place the way some people describe it."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"How can you resist a roof deck?! When the weather is nice, this is a great spot to spend some time. I came for brunch on a Saturday morning and the french toast did not disappoint."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"A commercial draw with no good food.Food (0/3 stars) I've never been impressed with the food in this place and I've been here many times. Most meals appear to be thrown together from a bunch of ingredients you buy from Sysco or Costco. Pre-made everything, not hard to tell. And the worst part is this place is expensive. Save your money people. Atmosphere (0.5/1 star) Pretty cool place but its way too crowded.Service (0.5/1 stars) Hit or miss.Main Enjoyment: The atmosphere. The only thing I enjoy here is going to the roof and having a beer.Main Complaint: The food, terrible and overpriced. Not restaurant quality."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,Tried it again. After a 45min wait we asked them what was up and that's when they told us it was an hour and a half wait :(. Wait Staff are friendly but not communicative.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,My fiance and I wanted to try this place and decided to sit on the rooftop patio which was very nice. We were sat fairly quick and our waitress was over right away to take the drink order I ordered ribs and fries which were on special for half price and my fiance ordered a chicken sandwich the food wasn't great but it was the service that earned 3 stars
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,My friends wanted me to add their update while dining here yesterday around 430 pm Barb and Georgia ordered the nachos without onions 40 minutes later they came with onions the restaurant wasn't busy then the waitress took them Back 20 minutes later they came back without onions however a hair was melted in the cheese when they resent them back the third time they were then ok at the end they took 1.50 off the bill big deal this restaurant has certainly gone downhill very quickly and the cutlery and napkins weren't given to the ladies either they had to go by the bar in the dispensers and get them themselves I'd suggest to management open your eyes and make sure the proper headgear is worn while prep work or cooking and the wait staff doesn't neglect the cutlery that you would think would be automatic there's 2 more customers long term ones you have lost
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"I would say I'm a fan of the Stache. I have a great time each time I've gone. The service is friendly and prompt. Gold Star. They've got your standard pub food, I usually swing towards the nachos, which are massive (consider sharing these) not to mention pretty superb. The seating situation is perfect for your large group of friends to tag along, 10 close buddies? one booth? No problem. They got you. I'm all about the comfy booths and open spacious atmosphere.. and if you snag a window seat the view ain't too shabby. The patio is one of the most sought after in the city, and is always packed, but worth the hype. It's my go-to spot before heading to a late movie, or Friday after work drinks, or Saturday morning brunch for that matter. The brunch is pretty great now that I think of it... If you're into that kinda thing - check it out!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/your-fathers-moustache-halifax?hrid=Ew4ymnXSGN4EdMXyGPUPYg,Your Father’s Moustache,"We stopped by for lunch after walking around Halifax. Wife had fish an chips and I had fish tacos The tacos were great and as a plus I had poutaine, which I really enjoyed. Wife though the fish and chips was like any other pub. We both had great beers. Additionally we met three very super people, Tyler the barman, Jen the waitress and Bruce. I forgot to tell you that we ate on the roof deck which was great but lots of steps to climb."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"Great food, clean place. Good family restaurant. Very quick service.The food was Excellent. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma. Large portion of chicken meat, juicy and tender with lots of salad, humus and lovely garlic mayo.The rice was tasty as well.Been there again, never disappointed.Happy to take family and friends who are visiting.Would recommend to anyone.what i like about this place, it only makes halal food. Its all home cooking as if my mam was is making it . Also its very clean, where everything is cooked in front of you . Very healthy food, with no fat or preservative natural spices. And if you have been in Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, or Egypt, they have the most famous and traditional dishes for these countries such Jordanian mansaf, Saudi Arabia's kabsa, and a lot more. Its a wonderful place to visit, where you could experience different cultures all at once."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"Located on Dresden, Mashawee is one of several places in that area focused on the downtown lunch crowd. However, given where I work and live, I'm not often in the area at that time of day. This day, however, I was off and running some errands downtown so I thought I'd tick Mashawee of my list of places to try out.It's a small location, with seating for just over 20 inside, with a few more tables out on the patio. It's pretty bare bones inside, which is understandable as they're there to crank out lunches for office workers, not provide a fancy sit down dinner. It's basically a diner/cafeteria design, with an open kitchen and display case that run the length of the restaurant.The menu board had some interesting Middle Eastern options beyond the typical Lebanese fare that we're used to in here Halifax. This included mansaf - lentils cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt, bamya - an okra dish, and kebsa - a meat and rice dish.I wanted to try a couple types of meat so I went with their mixed kebab plate, choosing chicken and lamb. I sat down while they cooked the meat, having my run of the place as it was empty in the post lunch-lull. Once the kebabs were ready, I went up to the counter and they asked what type of rice I wanted, I went with their self-described yellow rice. The salad looked just like coleslaw, and it came with a big dollop of hummus as well.The rice was a vivid yellow, although it didn't taste particularly saffron-y, if that's what it was coloured and flavoured with. Nonetheless, it was cooked nicely and was very plentiful, so being the lover of rice that I am, it was a-ok in my book. Each skewer of meat had four decent-sized hunks on it and were nicely browned and moist. Even the lamb was tender, although I wished it would have had more of a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern seasoning. The salad/coleslaw was shredded cabbage and carrot; it was crunchy but nothing special.I paid at the counter when I was done, and it was $15 for my plate and water, pretty reasonable for the size of what I got.I don't know if I would make Mashawee a destination lunch again, but it's good to know that it's there as an option for a quick lunch and a pile o' rice."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"The meal was okay at best. The chicken shawarma plate was big, however the meat was rather dry as the owner took out of the fridge. The half chicken plate seems good, but the inside of the chicken was not fully cooked."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"Went there with hope to get a good shawarma wrap. The prices are very reasonable, and i guess it's the best part. The meat on the spit was cold, the seller had to warm it up about 10 min. The whole meat block looked like it was there from yesterday. I'm not sure if I'll be back there for lunch again."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"Eat here yesterday, take out was really good people have as well, food was well made and just Right, didn't eat there however, due to table not all that Clean"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"I liked this place. I lived in Ottawa for long enough to recognize quality Lebanese fast food and this is it. I had the falafel sandwich and some honey-sweetened cakes they had cooling on the counter. They were both pretty good. Overall the place seems like a small family-run place. Next time I'm in Halifax I'll try to go back, it's certainly better than any Shawarma place we have in Vancouver."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"Tried this gem for the first time today and I will be back! Fantastic wrap, likely the best I have ever had. The food was hot, fresh and so delicious. Great spot for lunch if you are working downtown."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"Another great find- awesome food, cheap price. I've had a lot of shawarmas over the years- YHZ, YUL, YOW, YYZ, YYC, YVR, even in NewYork, Los Angeles and Barbados. The quality here is second only to Kababji in Dartmouth, but this is a take-out restaurant vs. a dining venue. That's about it, really- surroundings are a bit shabby, but if you're looking for a high quality/price ratio- you won't beat this family-run place. Very nice family, I might add."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,"I popped in here looking for the last business to occupy the space and stayed to test out the newcomer. It's a nice piece of middle Eastern culture just off of the busy commercial area of Spring Garden Road. The TV was playing a soccer game with commentators speaking Arabic and wearing traditional head coverings. The food is typical for Mediterranean or Lebanese casual dining around these parts, with a falafel wrap running $5.50 and a chicken shawarma wrap for $6.50. You can get special plates with the same type of pita wraps or meat skewers along with rice, potatoes, and salad and the like if you're running on fumes and need to really refuel. I tried the falafel wrap on its own, and was asked if I'd like everything on it. Wary of super spicy peppers or anything I asked about those, which do not come standard on it, and assured the waiter I'd like the hummus and all that. The wrap was adequate, a little on the dry side but I've had much drier. I'd ask for extra sauces/dips next time.Overall, a welcoming space in a central area with inexpensive Mediterranean style food. I wouldn't make plans to go out of my way to eat there but it certainly works in a pinch."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/mashawee-mediterranean-grill-halifax?hrid=m2qWf2yDbAKiJU4L8nPFsA,Mashawee Mediterranean Grill,Excellent BBQ meat! Full of flavour and lots of it :) so authentic. Definitely will come back again!!

My boyfriend and I used to go to Turkish Delight for our mediterranean fix, but now we have a new favorite spot with super nice service!

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"This place is a super fun group activity, and the food is super tasty. The standard half and half broth that they recommend is a great way to try a two of the broths if you aren't sure what you like. The original broth is great, as well as the spicy one, however the spicy one is a bit oily if that bothers you. The is another spicier chongqing broth that you can try if you are adventurous, but I have found that the ""tingly spicy"" feeling can be unpleasant to those who aren't accustomed to it.As per the food selection, its is vast and cheap. My favorites are the pork belly, shitake mushrooms, and the enoki mushrooms (seriously if you aren't doing hot pot with mushrooms you're missing out!). There a lot to choose from, so multiple visits are required to really get a feel of the menu. I found that with a group, each of you should max aim to spend 15$ including tax, this will leave you stuffed for sure. It seems like currently not too many non-asian customers come by to this place. Which is a shame because it's so good! Still around dinner time, this place fills up, for good reason."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"This is mainly a hot pot restaurant. The main clientele appears to be Chinese students. The menu is in Chinese with one page in English - with the tamer menu choices.The wait staff speak predominantly Chinese. Went on a Monday night and it was exceptionally busy! Felt bad for the one waitress who was running around to every table.Ordered off the menu - wow, the portions were large. Also authentic Chinese - don't come here if you want combo one or two... That isn't the population this restaurant is catering too.The food came out fast, hot and fresh. Had a ton of leftovers. Definitely won't be ordering so much next time.Good value overall!"

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"Alas and alack...I'm afraid I have to temper my enthusiasm for Happy Veal after recently returning for lunch. Between the two visits, I'd rate it at a 3.5. Dinner was delightful, lunch...well, the soups were 70% noodles with a tiny bit of meat and bok choy. That was especially disappointing considering how generous the hot pot is with veg and meat quantities. In the light of day it was also easier to see how the furniture was in disrepair. One of the bathrooms was also incredibly dirty. Service was also poor. The TV was very loud and we had to fight for the server's attention.I'll give it another shot, but the difference between the two visits was night and day."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"We have eaten here several times. My wife (Shanghai Ren) loves this place and every time we are in the area, she wants to stop in. I'm not personally a fan of HotPot but its done very well. Its hard to find REAL athuntic places like this anywhere in Canada."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"This is the first authentic hot pot experience I've ever had. We got the mix of spicy/mild broth with pork belly and beef, shiitake mushrooms, bok choy, bamboo shoots, chives, and 2 beers which came to $65 (taxes in, no tip yet) for the 2 of us which we thought was a little expensive. The broth was tasty and the meats were thinly sliced and all delicious as well. The spicy broth was the appropriate amount (no need for Kleenex here!) and the mild one was a good switch so you don't get bored. I found when I put the veggies in, it got lost in the broth and that was sort of annoying.I would come back here again. Though it was yummy, just a bit expensive."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"This place is awesome!!! I will definitely be going here as often as I can in the future. We went after work today and had a hotpot with a variety of vegetables and meats (too much probably) and some pork dumplings. They serve the hotpot on a hotplate and you add vegetables and meats to taste. The flavor was incredible, the portion was massive, and although we definitely spent too much money it was totally worth it. Next time we will probably scale back our order, because we had no idea it would be so much food."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"The food here is as good as the many ""huo guo"" or ""fire pot"" restaurants in New York, including the Chinese implant, ""Xiao Fei Yang""-""Little Sheep"" which is a popular chain in China. If you're new to ""fire pot"", it's like a fondue in some ways. A boiling pot of broth is placed in the center of the table, and an array of meats and vegetables are cooked in the pot and shared by each diner. You use a slotted spoon to remove your foods. You might place your plate of lamb, or beef in the pot and then dip it in a sauce-the sesame sauce being the preferred sauce-and eaten. You can order various fish as well. They have an array of ""balls"" that might be ordered-lobster balls, beef, pork, shrimp, etc. These are similar to Japanese Oden-formed with meat and vegetables into a sort of meatball. The table next to use ordered a ""mashed shrimp"" which apparently can be formed into balls and cooked. We had beef and it was quite lean. We also had the mixed seafood balls. We ordered the very spicy soup, which they call ""chongqing"" spicy. It's not really terribly spicy by my standards, but some might find it so. It's served ""ma-la"" style meaning it's both spicy, or ""la"" in Chinese and a bit tingly-""ma"" from the famed ""fuajiao"" pepper which is not hot, but tingles a bit. You can order a non-spicy broth as well. Or you can order a 1/2 and 1/2 in which a pot will have spicy broth on one side, and non-spicy broth on the other. We also ordered a delicious lamb skewer as a side dish-and a pork knuckle. For those of you who like pork knuckle, it's has delicious and wonderful flavors, but not much meat. The eating-is of the gelatinous exterior of the knuckle which must be braised for many hours to soften. The flavors are delicious and rich tasting, for those of you who can handle it. The most famous restaurant, perhaps, in Canada is named for this dish-though it's served more French/Canadian style (Pied au Cochon). These ""barbecue"" dishes were spiced mostly with cumin and were delicious. I get the distinct impression that you need to actively ASK for the barbecue menu and the dumpling/noodle menu. BUT DO IT. Our vegetables for our ""fire pot"" were bamboo shoots, wood ears, enoki mushrooms (needle mushrooms), some chinese parsley looking vegetable, and noodles made of tofu called ""tofu skin"". We also had the home made noodles which are cooked at the end of the meal. These were firm and delightful noodles-amazingly well made. In the future, i would order the deep fried tofu. We were the only non-Chinese in the restaurant, but the waitress has a degree from university in Canada and helped us immensely. There's a great dumpling menu that I would love to try. For example, the lamb, beef or shrimp dumplings sound great. In addition, there's a special dumpling that they offer that sounds great too. This restaurant is quite authentic, and a surprising and delightful addition to the food-scape of Atlantic Canada."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"So... a friend and I went here and I was starving, so I started ordering everything off the menu. We ended up with enough food to feed 8 people, so we took the rest of it home. We got the half/half spicy and not spicy broth. The spicy broth (and keep in mind i like things spicy) was extremely spicy. So be warned. I ended up cooking most of the items in the non-spicy broth and using a bit of the spicy broth in my bowl to flavour it after. So what happens is that you walk in and choose what type of hot pot you want. Then you select items to put in that hot pot. We got the two meat special and got beef and shrimp paste (shrimp paste is awesome - I loved it), and then we got a bunch of vegetables. The portions are large, so I'd suggest getting two or three vegetables maybe, maybe even less. I don't know because I'm the one who ordered about 10 vegetables and definitely could not finish it all. You cook the dumplings in the hot pot too. It was good. I'd go back. I might try the lunch the next time because at dinner it was really empty, and I hear the lunch menu has different things on it."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"Great, authentic hot pots. The recommended mix is a good choice. Overall, it's very flavourful with great meat (and other protein) options. Portions are large and best for 2 people. Very casual. Excellent value. And likely for these reasons, it was quite busy on a week night."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/happy-veal-hot-pot-halifax?hrid=-PFmK5ur_zX2QjcRLDEBYA,Happy Veal Hot Pot,"I had a fantastic, cheap bowl of noodles with beef brisket here - probably the best I've had in Halifax. The noodles tasted home made but weren't. Still delicious, slightly spicy, served in a great broth with Chinese greens and green onion. I could see the dough being rolled for the dumplings through a window to the kitchen. I will try these and the hot pot next time I visit. Although the restaurant is in a great location, it's easy to miss. It's on the ground floor of Park Vic at the south end of the building."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,"I love me some Middle Eastern cuisine. This family-owned place has a good selection of that (plus a bunch of North American dishes, but why would you bother?).I was lunching on my own, and had a good meal. The dining room is small, and with only a few tables downstairs isn't crowded at all (there's another dining room upstairs, where the washrooms are). I had some soft pita and smoky hummus to start, followed by beef and chicken kebabs with rice and a grilled tomato. Wine came in a couple of sizes. Not a big selection, but it sufficed.Service was friendly and not overbearing. A few other groups came in whilst I was there, and one of those included some Middle Eastern ladies (always a good sign).By checking in with my Yelp app and ordering an entree I got a free dessert! Let's hear it for baklava.Classier than a diner or pub, but essentially comfort food. Great for lunch on a cold day, or large groups."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,The food wasn't bad however I think the vision for the restaurant is a bit skewed. It calls itself a wine bar yet only has 8 wines on the menu. It offers Persian food along with a heavy North American bent for hamburgers etc. The shish kebabs were delicious. We also tried the profiteroles - they seemed like they were bought commercially rather than made in house. I think I would have preferred this restaurant if it was fully Persian and wasn't trying to fit into an already packed restaurant scene by offering the 'typical' Canadian menu.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,"Went to this place with the Groupon for 2, ""worth 55$"". My girlfriend and I were sat by the window. It was frigid - I kept my heavy sweater on and my girlfriend wore her coat. The server did not stay in the dining area at all and instead only came in and out from the kitchen when people entered or a plate was ready to serve. The server did not seem like a people person and had a very hard time conversing with us, an awkward individual, perhaps there was a language barrier but his English was good.We presented our Groupon, and selected the Hummus for an app, we had no choice on a mix plate of kebabs, and selected Profiteroles and Baklava for dessert, which they were out of, and instead were offered the next cheapest dessert, the apple crisp ""just like mom used to make"". I requested a Turkish coffee, and my girlfriend asked for a caffeine free tea, and it was suggested we get the Persian tea. This was a black tea and came with a rock candy stick of sugar and most definitely had caffeine in it. The coffee was OK - the tea was not what we wanted.The hummus was OK, creamy, but a fairly thin amount on a plate with one pita worth of pita chips. I think I make better at home. We came hungry and quickly annihilated it. The kebabs and rice were again pretty average, the lamb was cooked just right but the beef was overdone and chewy. The chicken thigh and breast were decent, maybe a touch overdone. They all had good flavour which means this place has a glimmer of hope for the future. For a meal for two, I would expect some vegetables or sides, but this came without any. We took the opportunity with the server's appearance to get water - he only brought one for us to share... good thing we aren't afraid of each others cooties. Dessert took awhile to come out, maybe 30 minutes after our main. The profiteroles were the same ones you get from Costco or Superstore, done up with whip cream and chocolate sauce. They are tasty. The apple crisp was horrendous - my girlfriend thought it tasted like plastic or soap, I think I tasted an overwhelming dash of coriander in the crumble. Not part of mom's recipe. After the Groupon, with our coffee and tea, the bill was over 20$ with tip. That prices this meal for two around 60$ before tip without the Groupon. We left hungry, I was starving. For the value they place on their menu, this place is overpriced or the Groupon value is skewed heavily to make it seem like a good deal, when in reality its below average at best. The dining experience was pretty bleak and leaves me looking forward to what new restaurant will take their place once they are gone."

We found the service attentive and friendly, the food GREAT (try the Fesenjoon - it's amazing), and the place classy. The chef went above and beyond- giving me tips to try cooking Persian food at home even! It was nice to see good local cider available along with the wine and beer. Definitely give this place a try"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,"I should start this review with this disclaimer: I bought a Groupon for this place, the one where you pay a set amount and it's a set menu dinner for two. We got an appetizer of hummus and pita to share, then an assortment of kabobs and rice, then profiterole rolls and baklava for dessert. There were a couple options, but it was basically set. Pretty amazing for around $27. The kabobs were fantastic! We had chicken breast and thigh, lamb and beef. My personal favourite was the chicken thigh. It was just enough food, maybe too much by the time I finished dessert. The profiteroles were delicious, I wasn't a fan of the baklava, but it was still good. The restaurant itself is very nice, with a big fireplace and comfortable seating with the big booth option. It's not a large place, and although it looks mega fancy inside, it's kind of the allusion of fancy. Our napkins where made of paper and not that it's a bad thing, but the place looks and feels more like the upscale cloth napkin kinda place. All in all it was delicious and a great expereince!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,"First of all, to save some confusion, know that Brenton's isn't actually on Brenton Street - it's on Clyde Street. What trouble I had finding the place when we parked on Brenton and thought it was in Brenton Place. I had my phone out and was using the GPS navigation to finally figure it out. This first visit of mine was on an overcast Thursday in October around 5pm. It's upstairs from where the Cellar used to be (now a new Chinese restaurant that I'd like to try as well). When you do arrive at Brenton's, there's a main level with about seven tables? And apparently you can go upstairs to another room of the same. Very nice, spotless décor with fireplace, a bar, warm colors. The server seemed a bit shy and spoke minimally, but was pleasant. We were the first customers to arrive for the day, and within an hour, three more tables had filled up. We overheard people using a Groupon coupon deal for their meal, which I didn't know about in advance or would have considered. Food took awhile to come, but was very good when it did. I had the Persian Platter (Kookoo, a vegetable & herb frittata, kashke bademjan, mast-o-khiar (Persian dips), falafels and Persian seasoned mashed potatoes. Served with fresh pita. 13.50) which just hit the spot. Technically it's an appetizer but was big enough to eat as a meal for me, and I'm a big eater. The other in my party had the chicken pesto ( Tender slices of chicken with bacon, tossed in our house made pesto, with your choice of al dente linguini or penne noodles. Served with toasted garlic bread. 15) and it was also very good, just the right size. The Profitroles (pastry made with croux paste filled with whipped cream and custard drizzled with chocolate sauce. 5) for dessert were delicious...cool, soft and melt in your mouth, and I think 4 or 5 in the dish. I'd definitely go back here anytime."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,We had a great meal tonight. The mixed Persian appetizer was delicious as were the kebabs and the Persian Stew. Atmosphere was nice too. My husband thought it was particularly good as almost all the dishes were gluten-free!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,The food is great. I had the vaziri combo which is basically a skewer of koobideh and a skewer of chicken kebab. The quality is high end and the presentation of the dish is also up to par. I certainly recommend this restaurant. Have fun with persian food.

Will return to try more of the mains, they all sounded great!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,"I would give this restaurant no stars if it was at all possible . Went this past weekend with a groupon. Made a reservation , when we got there a table wasn't ready but there were busy so we didn't mind. We were then sat at what can't even be called a table and promptly forgotten about . The hummus came and had no flavour . The groupon was suppose to include a kebab platter . Over an hour after getting our appetizer we flag someone down to ask to move and she tells us then oh by the way were out of kebabs so just choose something different off the menu . We chose the pan fried haddock and my boyfriend chose the lamb chops . The fish wasn't fresh but it was edible , my boyfriends meal on the other hand wasn't even close to edible , they weren't even lamb chops, I am honestly not sure what part of the lamb they were and they were burnt . His potatoes were cold and disgusting at that . The dessert which came with the groupon was profiteroles . They were not homemade and we're still frozen. All and all were there for over two hours , the food was awful and we were forgotten about when it came to service . Avoid at all costs"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,The food is delicious. Each morsel of rice is deliciously buttery and perfect to the bite. The flavors are rich and the char from the grill is the perfect touch. The chicken thigh kabob is just so good.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/brenton-grill-and-wine-bar-halifax-2?hrid=xVB_9TG_VMxiSvZc-2a0pg,Brenton Grill & Wine bar,"Kabobs were amazing. The ground beef was the especially good one, which surprised my group. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be returning."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,Really good Korean tacos!!! And loved that they have a little patio area in the summer time to eat at. Will be back!!!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I love the chicken pho here - it's inexpensive and quick to get to you. Probably more of a fast food than most, but I hate to qualify it as that. It's delicious!I tried the small pho and half bahn mi deal they had on and it was great! I had the chicken pho (of course) and the pork meatball bahn mi. I loved the pork meatball bahn mi - the bread was crunchy and fresh, the toppings were delicious...but the chillies. I hadn't counted on the chillies. I don't do well with spicy foods and it felt like my mouth was on fire after one of the chillies hit me. It had been great before that, but oof. If you're not as much of a heat wuss as I am you probably won't have a problem, it's just something to be aware of!I love the grab and go atmosphere of Indochine, but I wish they had actual dishes to use if you decided to eat in the restaurant. It is a pretty small location so I imagine they want people to eat quickly and leave, but it would sure be nice to eat out of ceramic instead of styrofoam."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,I was excited to come back and try something other than the chicken as their chicken seems grounded and put back together as mentioned in my previous review. The fish i think was breaded. There wasn't much fish but the taco was super tasty and I enjoyed it. I decided to get the beef banh mi as I am not a huge pork fan. The beef was tasteless and chewy. I ended up taking out the beef so I ended up with a vegetarian sandwich. Quite expensive for that and I am left disappointed.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I've liked going here in the past. My sister used to live in Halifax and introduced me before she moved away. She's a vegan, so this place has lots of veg options, apparently their sandwiches are just amazing - but I've never had one. I usually drop in when I'm in the area for bubble tea. This past Friday I was sitting in some particularly awful traffic after having been called downtown late in the day. I decided to drop by to wait out the traffic a bit. I ordered the mango peach (hindsight: 20/20, not a great combo) bubble tea, and hopped back in the car. First sip, tapioca pearls are crunchy - undercooked. After spending over $5 and anticipating a great on-route home snack, I ended up trying to consume it a few more times and, ultimately, it ended up not even 1/4 finished in my trash bin. Very disappointing, guys. If you're after bubble tea, keep heading downtown to Inglis!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I adore this place. I have stopped in countless times to get a banh mi sandwich and chow down at the high counter onsite or scoot across to the public gardens to find a sunny bench and enjoy. My favourite is the lemongrass chicken with everything. Be aware, everything includes cilantro, carrots, daikon, cucumber, and tiny slivers of a very hot red pepper. I love to get it with the pepper and then carefully pick out the pieces so I get the flavour contact and heat without overdoing it. The Korean tacos have also been excellent when I can bear to depart from my fave, and a great way to go is the pho (chicken or tofu) plus half a banh mi or one taco. Everything is fresh and delicious. Try their homemade organic lemonade with mint or whatever flavour they're serving up, it's refreshing and worth it! They also have canned Italian sodas and Propeller sodas, Perrier, bottled water. The service is friendly and quick, and it's a perfect spot to meet a friend or people-watch near the hotel complex next door. Highly recommended."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I pass by this place regularly and every time there are smells that can make you fall to your knees and dream a little dream about wonderful delicious food.When I checked out their menu and found they had tacos, I had to try it.I had the following... - Korean tacos served in a warm flour tortilla topped with Asian coleslaw, pickled daikon, cucumber, bean sprouts, citrus mayo and sriracha. - 1 Bulgogi Beef and 1 FishAwesome fresh ingredients and lots of flavour! The citrus mayo gives it a cool zesty taste however the sriracha gives it a bit of heat!I like spicy and it does give a bit of heat however not enough if you are afraid of heat to begin with.they are fairly big in size, so you can get away with having 1 if you are just looking for a quick snack or 2 for a lunch which I did.I will be visiting this place again!!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I have done a review for this fabulous sandwich shop in the past and it still remains one of my favorite spots to go to. It is quick, delicious, and healthier than most other places. It has a good variety to keep you coming back, and a reasonable price range for a broke-ass students like me. Today, I just had their new ""munch box"", and it was 10.00 after tax. Before that, I have also had their kimchi fries, Bahn Mi, and pretty much everything else on the menu. My overall consensus? It's simply great. That being said, there are some things that I kept having problems with the food. For instance, the baguette for the Bahn Mi are so often over-toasted; the problem being when you bite it off, it is hard and crusty it'd scratch the top of my palette in an uncomfortable way. Don't get me wrong, I love the sandwich - but when every bite hurts, it becomes more and more difficult to stay loyal. Then there's the tacos. I know they leak, but sometimes they leak more than the Mexican tacos. At least give me a plate or something! Lastly, the munch box. At $10 after tax, I was expecting a bowl of goodies that'll put a smile on my stomach. It came in a take-out box, which was a bit inconvenient for eating -in. The food? Well, there wasn't enough rice. I'm not sure if it was a budget problem or something, but the dish was definitely begging for more. It was a similar problem I had with the red curry that Indochine had sold earlier. I mean, it is good, but when another Korean store is selling a filling bowl of BiBimBap for $5 or a Japanese diner with a $7.25 special, it really makes you reconsider your options. All that aside, I still love Indochine. I hope those comments comes around as supportive rather than hostile, because I really want to see this restaurant succeed become more successful than it already is. We need more shops like this around town. Keep at it, guys!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"As I sat there in the warm afternoon sun, I found my stomach yearning for authentic Western cuisine. That's when I stumbled across Indochine - the pungent aroma was wafting through the open door, beckoning me to come inside. I had heard about their so called ""fusion"" tacos, blending the Korean and Mexican cultures together in harmony. My partner and I are interracial, so we take anything that combines races as a ""teachable moment"" to open up and learn more about each other. We ordered the chicken and tofu tacos, respectively, both which had a hot bulgogi marinade that danced on the delicate verge of pleasantly spicy. We lingered, enjoying the casual yet intimate ambience, feeding each other tacos whilst maintaining intense eye contact. Overall, the food pleasantly filled up our stomachs and left our tongues slightly numb in a good way.Parking was hard to get - 1 star off for that."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"This was my first time in here, I came for the pho and fell in love with the Korean fusion tacos. Hello favourite thing of 2015! Have you tired those tacos? They're amazing. No joke. I had the beef Korean taco and the chicken pho. The quality to price ratio is way off, so cheap for such amazing food! This location is great for take aways as its a small store front, the service was quick and very friendly. If you want to sit and enjoy a meal there are a few seats, and lots of seating outside. Hello summer seating! Or as I like to call them, freedom seats. How I've missed you."

I don't eat pork so I can't speak to the items on the menu that has them but I have tasted literally everything else. It's always fresh, high quality food. The price is amazing and the staff are sweethearts. I haven't been to the one on Barrington street but I'll be stopping by soon. I so hope that it's the same"

This is a waste. For soup, it's also less enjoyable than eating out of the traditional Vietnamese bowl in which pho is served.2. The food was bland.3. The chicken looked like it was processed and glued together - it wasn't shaped as chicken parts should have been.4. There were only chicken and vegetarian pho options, no meat options.5. The portions were small.6. The experience of the location was uninspiring and modern / corporate. It had no character.I would rather not eat than eat here."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I often have cravings for a Bahn Mi sandwich and I love that I can come here to get a very good one. The bread and toppings are very fresh and the meat is usually good. My last sandwich I found quite a bit of fat in my meat which I did not enjoy or expect... Some people don't mind this but many people do, I wish they would make sure to cut off the fatty bits before cooking or marinating. The mint lemonade was amazing and refreshing. I once got bubble tea here and it was overpriced,, tiny and not what most bubble tea is like.. It was basically a coconut slush with bubbles for like 5 dollars very very small. It's strange but there aren't any bubble tea places in Halifax really.... So I guess this is what people think it is and don't mind. I will go back but I think I'll be getting the tofu Bahn MI."

They offer quite a few options that are naturally vegan or can be made vegan. I got the Buddha bowl is naturally vegan. It has fresh bean sprouts, rice noodles, cucumber, carrots, parsley, tofu and a spring roll cut up. They provide 3 sauces with it, for a nice diverse taste. It was delicious, fresh and perfect for a hot summer day. Service was prompt and great. They answers my questions regarding vegan options with ease. The organic mint lemonade was delicious as well! Definitely a great little spot."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"The baguette is what makes or breaks a Vietnamese sub. Viet subs were influenced by the French, and we all know French take their baguette seriously. Indochine's baguette in my opinion is what makes their subs so outstanding. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed my first taste of Indochine's subs today, at least the baguette part. I ordered the lemongrass chicken and satay pork (they didn't have the spicy beef today). I was a little disappointed at the chicken. I was expecting pieces of grilled chicken marinated in lemongrass goodness, instead it was almost a chicken salad with lemongrass flavoured mayo mixed together. The satay pork was also on the lighter side in terms of colour. Doesn't satay usually means grilled? I wish they would treat their meat more seriously as they have with their baguette. However, I am grateful to find such a place in Halifax, where Vietnamese subs are a rare find. I also appreciated the proximity to the Public Gardens, where I devoured my sub with my little one. Mango smoothie bubble tea was awesome! The sweetness balanced out the spiciness of the sub. A perfect match."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I decided to give this place a try. I wanted a snack and thought that a bahn mi would be perfect. After looking over the reviews, I decided to try it all (I couldn't fit in a fusion taco though).I ordered the pho, bun and a 1/2 bahn mi (pork belly). First of all, I want to say that a lot of this review is based on their bahn mi. Their bahn mi is pretty damn good. They give you an option of white or whole wheat, and have a bunch of different fillings you can put in them. I got everything in the sandwich but one thing I noticed is that they don't kill the sandwich with birds-eye chilis (which is kinda nice). I've had sandwiches that were super hot. I recommend the pork belly, it was pretty spectacular. The bun and pho however, were horrible. They're made with fresh ingredients, but the noodles are wrong, the broth has no flavour and they only either have chicken or vegetarian. Their chicken also was kinda weird. Tasted like deli store chicken.Although I thought their pho and bun were terrible, I still would recommend Indochine for the sheer awesomeness of their banh mi."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"Ok. So, here's the deal: My brother eats here for lunch everyday. He regularly gushes to me about the magical sandwiches they make here. I've heard how the Banh Mi here is to die for, how the pork belly is better than sex. I've listened and I've always had those words at the back of my mind. ""Best Sandwiches Ever."" Someday, I would need that information. Someday was yesterday. I was having the kind of day that only an amazing sandwich can fix. And wow, did this do the trick!A long multigrain baguette, layered with your choice of protein (I tried the lemon chicken), a tangy citrus mayo they make in house, cucumber, pickled carrot and daikon, chillies and cilantro, are you joking?! How can this not be sandwich paradise? It is, my friends. It is.Also, an aside: For those of you who can taste cilantro, what does it taste like? It's a bottle of dishwater soap for me."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/indochine-banh-mi-halifax?hrid=DZ0jUJfXGGpRPK9WNUhLJg,Indochine Banh Mi,"I always had mixed feelings about banh mi. I'm not a fan of cilantro... And they use a lot in their sandwiches. With that said... I ask for none. No problem. The pickled dikon and carrots are a little weird to me especially when placed on such a great baguette. That said, the pork filling and chicken filling I've tried are great. With that nice bread it seals the deal for something different to try for lunch. It's not my favorite spot... Just my preference in what I look for in a sandwich"

The prices are reasonable, the menu varied, and the service was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Our server (Alison) was especially helpful with our wine pairings.

As soon as you walk in, you can tell they have different decor but still have the same atmosphere.I'm really not happy that all their restaurants are always SO loud. I'm not sure if that's a 'technique' or something but it's really not fun to have to yell to the person beside you. Having dinner with my grandparents here would result in very little talking.I ordered the Mac & Cheese, and it was really good but average. From this family of restaurants I always expect the best (Bicycle Theft has THE best lasagna!) but I found the Mac & Cheese could have had something extra? Maybe that's just me? The drinks were really good, a little pricey for me personally but good!Overall, I don't know if I would go out of my way to go back here, but would defiantly still recommend it."

The vibe is casual fine dining and a diverse crowd of patrons. Our waiter was amazingly attentive without being in your face. We mentioned a poor experience we had at Cafe Chianti, and that this was our first time at Frasca's. At the end of the meal another gentleman (owner? Manager?) stopped by to thank us for trying them out. Now that folks is how exemplary customer service is done! My husband and I both ordered a salad, I had the R&R salad and my husband had the Caprese salad. Both were amazing, I am still surprised I can gush about a simple salad! Mine was charred just enough to give a smokey BBQ taste while still being fresh and light. My husband also had the seafood risotto and I had Arancini. Both were amazing. Filling without being too heavy. Before here, one of the best Italian restaurants I had been to was in Ethiopia, where having almost been colonized by Italy they have a good grasp of Italian food. My husband has been to Italy a few times and was equally impressed.I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,Might not be a fair review... So I'll have to redo this when I actually go and sit. My dad brought me an order of calamari. Don't know what he paid for it hopefully jot a lot. Didn't get very much. Maybe a cups worth. The dipping sauce was great. I know it's a different experience between take out and table service... But it should still have a little crisp and not have the batter falling off and swimming in grease.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"Think I give here a 4.5 actually. Ate here a few times in the last year or so, and will start going more often for sure. The atmosphere is very modern and trendy. I prefer a cozy corner in the back, but there is some natural lighting coming in the front section, if that's your thing. Lots of interesting decor items around, with unique chandeliers, random artwork, etc. A couple dozen tables I would say, with room for groups, as they will push tables together. Capacity of maybe 100? Reservations I would definitely recommend on the weekend. On weekdays you should have no trouble getting in whatsoever. A drizzly Tuesday for lunch in July, the place was less than half full. During Burger Week it was packed on a rainy Monday though. The food is great. The free bread comes with a flavored whipped butter. The Caesar salad ($10) is made in the standard method, but one of my favorites in the city for having just the right amount of dressing, and a nice flavor, with crunchy homemade croutons and fresh parm. I have mine without the bacon, but it is still very satisfying. Really enjoyed the Gnocchi (handmade pasta, San Marzano tomato, cream, spinach, basil pesto, gratinéed with montasio cheese $17) as well. Lots of flavor, and a mid-sized portion where I was full without being too full. Also enjoy their Local Goat Cheese pizza (béchamel, herb pesto, roasted sweet squash, mozzarella, crispy kale chips. 17). A bit heavy on the oil, but a satisfying thin crust and tasty. Love their Ravioli (sweet squash filling, mascarpone & gorgonzola sauce, toasted pistachios, biscotti crumbs, sage 18.) It's a good size for lunch where I was pretty full but not bursting. The Arancini (smoked cherry tomato rice croquettes, fresh mozzarella centre, golden fried, tomato & basil sauce $11) are three good sized risotto balls and the sauce is incredibly flavorful. The Insalata Autunno (stacked roasted root vegetables, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto vinaigrette, tomato couscous $12) is delicious and filled me up by itself for lunch. The couscous is not the tiny grain variety that I'm used to, but larger balls that for a second I thought were some sort of pea. I usually get a bottle of their Luckett Tidal Bay, for no other reason than it's familiar to me and I like it, without being expensive. My partner really likes the Pappardelle (slow braised pulled pork belly ragù, wild mushrooms, crispy onions, parmigiano. 19) and although not full from it, was satisfied portion wise. He also loves the Negroni cocktail and dessert coffees. I can't get their dessert menu to open online for the details, but a hazelnut torte was very good. Various flavors of gelato are always a nice touch, which I often get even if I wasn't able to finish my meal. Very friendly service. I look forward to going back any time."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"Many a person in Halifax were surprised when the Bertossis decided to completely re-brand one of the city's restaurant staples, il Mercato, and I was certainly included in that group. But after being to La Frasca, I can definitely appreciate the upgrades.To start, the atmosphere is much warmer and more intimate. More softly lit, and with lots of dark woods, it's more inviting than I found il Mercato to be and I didn't find it overly cramped as some people have said. It lends itself to a bustling, lively vibe in the place which I can appreciate. Needing seating for just two, my girlfriend and I didn't have to wait long before getting a table. Starting off with some bread and a wonderful garlic butter, I also enjoyed this switch from the olive oil and balsamic that il Mercato had. Call me unrefined, but I'll take a good butter over those any day.Although we'd planned on coming out anyway, good news turned the evening into a bit of a celebration so I ordered a bottle of Sangeovese, which is like the younger, more accessible Chianti. It was a little less potent than the Chianti, but it was still good, especially at half the price of its elder brother. To start, we split the frico, a wafer of fried Montasio cheese, potato, onion and pancetta. While a little on the tough and greasy side, it had some great flavours. It's pretty hard to go wrong with cheese, onion and fancy bacon, really. For my main, I was torn between one of my favourite fowls to eat, the duck breast, and the quail dish. Being the somewhat adventurous sort, I readily jumped at the chance to try the quail, a meat I've never had before. Polenta fries on the side also helped the quail's case. I was apparently quite focused just on the fact that it was quail and was surprised to see it breaded and fried when it arrived, having expected a more rustic roasting or the like. A buttermilk soaking gave it a nice tang on the back end, the coating was nice and crispy and the fig gravy added a well-balanced mix of sweetness and richness to round out the dish. Now I knew that quails were small, but nothing prepared me for the smallest, cutest wings I've ever eaten. I would have felt guilty if they weren't so delicious and for the fact I'm an unrepentant omnivore. The Jenga-esque stack of polenta fries were enjoyably plentiful and crisp, with a really good, garlicky sauce. Polenta fries are seriously becoming one of my favourite sides, with their more prominent flavour and more textures than regular potato fries. Buttery beans and turnip wedges were the mandatory vegetable components of the plate, but took a backseat to the quail and polenta fries. With pro service that was knowledgeable and never let our wine glasses go empty, and a more diverse and modern menu than its predecessor, I'm giving La Frasca the thumbs up and look forward to coming back and conquering some new animals on my plate."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"As a big fan of the former Il Mercato at this location, I was wary of the new resto. Fortunately my fears were allayed as soon as we walked in.The interior has definitely changed, and for the better. Warm and cozy are good words to describe the new look. Wooden beams have been added to the ceiling, and some walls are brick and some have collages of Italian posters to peruse as you wait for your food. I recognized some of the old staff but saw many new faces as well.The menu is perfect, with something for everyone. I tried the spaghettini with smoked bacon and Mike had the daily lunch express, which consisted that day of a small pizza, spinach salad and a strawberry tart for dessert. Everything was really good. I do miss the olive oil and balsamic vinegar provided with bread in the past (the bread now comes with butter), but I can always head to the Bedford Il Mercato if I'm desperate. :-)Service was lovely and our food came very quickly. The wine list is EXTENSIVE, as is the beer list. We were unable to partake on this occasion but on future visits? Absolutely!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"I revisited this place after they changed it from Estia Restaurant and I must say it did NOT impress me the least...I had the spaghettini [without the veal meatballs] and just a glass of cola. and as such I wasn't too thrilled at the noodles, and sauce, i've had much better and same with the focaccia bread [which only had 2 slices...]Now my reason for the rating are as followed1. The front doors don't look like doors/inviting and that it looks like the entrance is inside the building beside it [but it's nothing but stairways]2. The lighting is crap, I was fortunate enough to come in daylight but still. I'm hard of seeing and after a certain amount of time It's hard to steer out of there3. When I finally got my meal I was nibbling on the bread slices and nearly shocked to several glasses shattering in the kitchen. I know it was an accident but I was able to spit the bread out before I started to choke [also someone from another table asked if I was alright]4. The Waiter has scared me not once but twice from coming from behind instead of coming up and facing me at the table, he comes from behind and asks me without warning that he's there scaring the crap out of me. and when deciding if I even want dessert at this point he gives me the menu to look and spouts that his favorite was the Hazel nut Caramel Tort. and I held it back but wanted to bark out ""If I wanted your opnion I'd ask."" but told him politely to give me a moment.....10 minutes later....still waiting so I got fed up and even asked one of the waitresses to get my bill....and after 5 minutes he comes back and tends to me. I paid but no tip.Final conclusion? This place has gotten worse and it can't hold a candle to the marvelous Sister Restaurant that's in Bedford. I'll go there instead of here because I feel like much more at home with it's staff and much more of a valuable person there"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"Come here for the food. It's seriously delicious. I was excited to come here for a bachelorette party because I was a huge fan of Il Mercato and was hoping for a similar experience. I didn't receive it, but what I did get was good enough to me.I see a lot of reviews talk about the decor, which is nice, but also a little odd. I see they're going for a rustic look with the brick and wood, though the large branches in the lighting fixtures were a bit unnerving to me.Service was what you'd expect for a busy, large restaurant. Food came within a reasonable time and the waiter was pleasant and checked in when necessary. Nothing less, but no flair either.What I came here to write about, though, is the food. Before I talk about how delicious my meal was, let me mention that I am HORRIBLE with big menus. They overwhelm me. I always want to try something new but looking at menus of 4+ pages always drive me towards what I know and love. Here, if I remember correctly it was two pages and to the point. Starters, salads soups, mains and not-italian mains. Also, I can't remember a time in recent history that I saw so many items on the menu that I wanted to try. I love creative food and there was a lot of that on the menu; from Mac & Cheese to pesto Gnocchi (which I arrived craving) to squash ravioli. Seriously, yum. My sister and I shared the mussels to start, which were in a delicious tomato sauce that was great to dip bread in, and I had the Orechiette for my main. It came in a piping hot cast iron skillet and smelled amazing. It was so hot and took a bit to cool down, but it was worth it (and helped me eat a bit slower). I was pleasantly surprised to find crumbled bacon on top of the dish which was large shells filled with the mozzarella mixture and covered with a creamy tomato sauce. Everyone at the table was pleased with their meals (and wine!) and it was certainly an enjoyable restaurant to be in. Definitely recommended if you enjoy good Italian and run-of-the-mill service."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"This place certainly takes the cake for the worst high end dining experience I've had unfortunately. I hate to be the one to write a bad review amongst really great reviews but I really didn't have a great experience! I came here with my friend's family for a birthday supper. His family consists of mostly vegans so we realized the amount of stuff on the menu they would be able to order was fairly limited. However the server informed us that the chef could vegan-ize almost anything. That was nice but honestly it was really where the good ended. My first complaint would be the lighting, it was to the point that my friend with poor vision was completely unable to read the menu and I had to read it to him. I realize a restaurant like this wants to achieve ""mood lighting"", but I don't think that means turning all the lights off. The second was the cocktails we ordered. They both sounded unique and tasty but were extremely disappointing. My friend ordered the ruby red one which had grapefruit juice in it and tequila, I ordered one that had grapefruit and pink pepper as a few of the ingredients. His was salty and so was mine. I kind of expected a drink that wasn't going to be sweet but we were both surprised that his was salty seeing as all the ingredients in his cocktail were fruit juices. He ended up sending it back and it was at that point I realized the server was really smug and rude. To finally get to the food I ordered the mushroom ravioli, my vegan friend ordered a primavera pasta and his family both ordered a pasta with oil and mushrooms in it. My ravioli was pretty good although the serving size was amazingly small, 2 pieces of ravioli is not enough for $16. My friend that ordered the primavera was extremely disappointed as it was bland and plain. He said he could very easily make it at home and hes completely right, I bet you could get some canned sauce for $5 that would taste as good. I didn't try the mushroom pasta but his family seemed to enjoy it. After finishing my ridiculously small ravioli plate I ordered a hazelnut chocolate torte that was AWFUL. It was very obviously frozen and defrosted and was still frozen in some places. It also lacked flavor and was extremely mushy, and overpriced. I apologize for my long winded review but I was so disappointed I spent so much money here for something I could easily get elsewhere for half the price."

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/la-frasca-cibi-and-vini-halifax?hrid=X6ZNNEABybBAiAFGkgxbgA,La Frasca Cibi & Vini,"The ambience is nice. They've done a good job with the interior renovations. I used to come to Il Mercato a lot because it was my mother's favourite restaurant in town when she came to visit. She was here for her birthday in November so I decided to take her to try out the new restaurant. She had the duck breast and I had the duck confit ravioli. Her duck was absolutely superb - such good flavours. The duck confit ravioli, well, it tasted good but it didn't blow me away. I found the pasta dough to be a bit chewy. And the thing is, no matter how much I hate saying this, I found this place to be a bit overpriced.... My mother's duck breast was in the mid-20s and though it was delicious, it wasn't an overly filling plate. We both left feeling a bit hungry, though maybe we should have gotten an appetizer. But really, this is good food and the location is excellent for a night out. The waiter we had was awesome."

We chose La Frasca for a host of reasons. They took our reservations of 8 on a Saturday night. They have amazing pasta dishes (bride-to-be's favourite). They have an upscale but still casual atmosphere where our matching tank tops wouldn't feel out of place. We arrived 5 minutes before our reserved time and were seated immediately. The services was great. Our waiter was excited to have us and wished the best to the bride. The other patrons were also beyond friendly with several tables stopping to congratulate her on their way out. And of course, the food was perfect. Appetizers and mains came out in a timely manner and were shared around for all to sample. We left full in belly and spirit. This was the perfect start to a great evening. Thanks to all the staff at La Frasca!"

But not too worry: the Bertossis (Maurizio and Stephanie Bertossi) have yet created another gem of a restaurant at La Frasca!We were a largish group of 14, always testing for a restaurant, but no problem: food was great, wine was great, service was great, ambience is great. Terrific place; highly recommended.(Music may have been a tiny bit too loud. Maybe a generational thing :)"

The lighting was beautiful, warm and romantic, although it was a little too busy and noisy on a Friday night for this gal! I had the mushroom risotto which was incredible - perfectly cooked, rich and creamy. The addition of the tempura battered mushroom kebab was a doozy! I'd have a hard time choosing something different in my next visit, this was about as perfect as Italian food gets."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"I feel as though I never truly tasted sushi until I started coming here at the recommendation of my corworkers. They're really reasonably priced, have a great, low-key location that's beautifully decorated, delicious food, and lovely staff."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"A great little hidden gem. The sushi is basic (straight-up classics rather than the clusterf*** of wacky ingredients that is becoming the standard) but well-prepared with good ingredients. The katsu don was so delicious my roommate and I almost armwrestled for the last piece. Modestly priced and great value, too. Quick ""cafeteria"" style service that allowed me to indulge my fear of food commitment (we got some sushi, the katsu don, mix and match salads, and a mochi). Bonuses: unbelievably cute interior, very sweet staff, and a nice selection of Japanese candy and snacks to take home."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"I'd really give here a 2.5 I came here for a quick early supper on a Friday in February. It wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it was a regular sushi restaurant with waitor service, but you order at a counter and bring it to your table like fast food. Mind you, behind a glass wall, there is a more formal-looking dining section, which I am guessing is closed off for certain times or day or reservations? It looked off limits. Anyway, there were a few people hanging around eating while on their laptops like a cafe feel. Colorful tables with some random Asian decor. Dance music playing in the background. The menu has pictures and words written in Japanese above the counter, but there's one ON the counter in English, albeit no detailed descriptions. I only ended up choosing a tempura appetizer, avocado roll and sweet potato roll, but had been hoping earlier that they would have some more vegetarian fusion rolls. Not actually complaining, because the food is made fresh and tasted good, but there's nothing good enough about here to make me go back. If I worked in the building, or even on the block of Spring Garden, I probably would pop in if I had a sushi craving, but with all the other Japanese restaurants in the city, there are others I rather a lot more."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"Great place to get your japanese food fix. Nothing ""fusion"" or experimental here, just good ""the usual"" japanese food. Specials and combos are usually below $10, and they fill you up enough. They are japanese as well, so points for that if you feel its more authentic that way."

We came here just before closing time, which was a little disappointing because once you pass through the mall and food court down to the restaurant, it's quite nice and inviting. Nevertheless, we decided to get takeout. Both combos were very good and filling. Not a bad deal for 18$ including taxes! Some pieces were hard to fit into our mouths because they were a bit too big, but we managed somehow...;)The cashier was super nice and we had a lovely conversation while we waited for our order. It was also cool to watch them work, so fast and precise! If I am ever back in Halifax I would probably be back here!"

The menu might not be as big as other places and they don't have fancy ""chef rolls"" that are 14-15$ but you can tell these people take a lot of pride in serving their food. The lunch specials change every week but their all very good, and everything is very fresh. You get a good value for you money on the lunch specials. Their tonkatsu is also very tasty. The staff is always super nice and very helpful. I come here every week and will continue to do so."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"This was a good find and one of the reasons that Yelp and sharing information via internet is such a great improvement to our lives. I would have never have found this place on my own.I had the famous Yoga roll (pretty good), a barbequed eel roll and a salmon roll. Very nice. Same quality as Sushi Nami Royale for half the price.The catch? Well- not much of a catch, really- but it was hard to find- tucked in the basement of a non-descript office building/small mall. Oh- and it's cash or debit only. Still- I don't give 5 stars readily and this place deserved all of 'em today."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"Thank goodness for Yelp or I wouldn't have ever found this place.Even then it took a bit to figure out where it was. In the basement of the Mills Mall on Spring Garden Road. Quick, affordable sushi in an unlikely location. I had a combo with a cucumber/avocado roll, a sweet potato tempura roll and a piece of nigiri. The sushi was rather large (had to eat some with my hands straight up) and the rice was slightly overdone but all in all for $9 it was pretty great. My main quibble however has to do with how much waste is involved in their operation. The plates the sushi come on are Styrofoam. The salad comes in a plastic container and the dressing is also in a little plastic container inside the salad container. Just too much waste. I would like to go back to get some sushi sometime but the waste involved is excessive. They have what looks like a good amount of space as well so reusable plates and bowls should be an option for dine in methinks.Might have to come back with my own container sometime."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"Heads up! They've moved! I don't know how long ago they moved...it's been quite a while since I've been there. They're no longer the first place you see when you hit the bottom of the stairs. In fact, I was meeting friends there and when I went down to the bottom floor I turned around and I had to text my friends to ask where they were. Just hang a right and keep walking...you'll eventually make it there. On that note, the new location is much better! It's actually a place all to itself now with cute decorations and lots of space to sit. The food still tastes the same and everything is very tasty and fast. Also, some of the rolls are huge!Still not a fan of this place being cash only. Who actually carries around cash nowadays anyways?? But that's really the only drawback."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"Ko-Doraku is not the best sushi in Halifax. However, it is the best quick and affordable sushi I have found so far.To give you an idea, in the last 3 weeks I have gone here 7 times (I know because I have a lunch card that I can't wait to redeem when I get to 10!)I usually get vegi sushi because I don't eat fish and have not had a roll I haven't liked.The average price with a drink comes to about 7 or 8 bucks, and really where else can you get a consistent good lunch for 8 bucks!?.... if you know please tell me because I can't eat sushi EVERY day!One more thing. If you are paying with debit bring a few bucks in change for a tip because they don't have an option on the machine :)"

https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"Just the best maki-sushi in HRM. Wow. What a hidden gem. The specials are excellent. The price is moderate. The quality is the highest. I go to different Japanese restaurants for different items depending on what I'm craving and I go here when I'm craving sushi rolls.To me, there are 2 things that distinguish good from amazing sushi rolls. 1) The rice and,2) The riceWe could talk about fish quality all day, but to me, great maki sushi is all about achieving perfectly seasoned, temperature controlled, expertly steamed rice and the chef at Ko-Doraku takes so much pride and care with rice preparation that the bags of rice are even featured as part of the restaurant's decor. As the Japanese government forbids rice exportation, expat Japanese chefs must have a hard time deciding on which (Californian) rice to use in place of their beloved Japanese grain. The chef at Ko-Doraku has found some magic formula to creating the best sushi rice in Halifax. Ko-Doraku does rice perfectly. If you think that's a silly thing to base a sushi review on, because ""well, isn't all rice the same"" then head over to Ko-Doraku (go early because they often sell out of stock early), order your favourite rolls and eat them right away when they are served. Notice the warmish temperature of the rice and how it affects the fragrance of the rice seasoning. Notice how the sweetness is lifted by the rice's temperature (if you don't believe me, save one piece and take it home to eat from the fridge later to note the differences). Notice how the individual grains lightly stick together that seem to melt away from each other when you have a bite in your mouth. If you order a traditional roll containing just fish (plus possibly sauce), notice how the rice seasoning compliments the fish differently when it is served warm. The subtleties of the maki coming out of Ko-Doraku's kitchen may go unnoticed by some sushi goers, but for those who are on a quest for the divine sushi experience, Ko-Doraku should be a mandatory stop over. I've had a few blissful moments in my life, and experiencing Ko-Doraku makisushi for the first time had me in a state of awe, pleased at life."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/ko-doraku-halifax?hrid=HVFuo0kcMK9cM_EF-5xkZA,Ko-Doraku,"I love coming here for lunch and have filled up many a yellow card with stamps. My personal favourite is the rainbow roll which is filled with creamy avocado, silky salmon and tasty tuna. You get 6 yummy pieces for $7, and, embellished with soya sauce, wasabi and a piece of pickled ginger, each slice of this roll is a taster's heaven. The service is fast and friendly too. I really like having sushi which is freshly made, just like they do here. I will be back!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Absolutely best sushi place in Halifax!!! Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and that tatami makes me feel like I am in Japan! They also have those separate booths make your date more mysterious! Me and my boyfriend ordered the undo, and spicy chicken bowl, both of them are really good! And I also recommend the sashimi special! Love this place!!!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Definately the slowest service ice ever had at any restaurant. From ordering to food coming took an hour. Even the miso soup want ready for an hour. It would make sense of maybe one person in our party ordered something requiring a long time to make, but it wasn't the case. Even though it took an hour for our food to stay arriving, one of our party was completely finished his meal before anyone else even got their food.Furthermore, this place is extremely expensive for what it is. Expensive prices for very little food.Will not be returning."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Really good sushi restaurant; a bit pricey, but great quality.Blink and you'll miss the entrance, especially when there's construction going on next door.I've had lots of sushi around the world, and have found the quality on both my visits to Suzuki to be very good. Soft shell crab roll, gyoza, sashimi, mixed sushi plates, the kara-age, it's all incredibly tasty, and nicely constructed and presented. You don't necessarily get as much for your money as some places, though.I like the restaurant layout, with sunken tables, cushions, and some curtained-off areas for dining.In Halifax, I go to Suzuki for quality sushi and the restaurant dining experience; I go to Wasabi House for stuffing myself."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"It's my first time here and the experience is awesome! My girlfriend and I really enjoy the whole meal and the atmosphere here is sooo good! Perfect place for a date! Highly recommend the sashimi, the fish (especially salmon & scollops) is really fresh! If it's your first time here, plz aware that all of their sauce(on the sushi roll) is really light because they want you to feel that the fresh fish. Highly recommend!!!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,The food in the suzuki is really good. The service is pretty awesome. This japanese restaurant is the best in halifax
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Maybe I'm spoiled coming from Toronto but I don't see how this restaurant can be rated as high as it is. First of all its priced ridiculously for what you're getting(price to quantity/quality, not price in general). $14 for 2 tiny pieces of eel on top of rice... $19 for 8 pieces of nigiri and 4 tiny rolls. Price would be justified if quality of food was something spectacular which wasn't. Rice felt too sticky. Good thing the Tonkatsu pork didn't run away. It was so undercooked. Service was okay. Interior was below average."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,Had an absolutely wonderful time here - so happy to have passed the hidden door! One of the most delicious sushi places in town for sure! And the black sesame ice cream is amazing!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"To quote another Yelper who reviewed this restaurant recently,""Maybe I'm spoiled coming from Toronto but I don't see how this restaurant can be rated as high as it is. ""I am not from Toronto, but I am a sushi fanatic and have been to nearly every sushi place in HRM. I can safely say that this sushi restaurant is average compared to other restaurants around here. I'll start with the positives, the atmosphere is nice, service was relatively quick, and staff were friendly, so that's all fine and dandy. It's located in a nice location, but man do I find it hard to return here when there are SO many other sushi places around the corner (and one literally next door...).I don't see what's so special about this place. I'm not against spending a lot of money for good food, and I believe in the concept that you get what you pay for. Except you aren't getting what you pay for here. You simply aren't getting good value by eating here. Sushi is average at best, it's overpriced, and quantities are lacking. All of this points to bad value and money not well spent.Don't see what all the fuss is about, or how the average rating is a 4.5. This is a 3 when compared to other HRM offerings, and a 1 or 2 if you compare it across our nation's sushi heavyweights.-2 price/value"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"I think this is the most authentic Japanese restaurant in town-you can actually sit in a Japanese-style cube and the interior decoration is also very Japanese style. The air brushed salmon is a must try, I don't give a five star just because it is expensive."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Keep an eye out on Dresden for this back-alley restaurant or you may miss it! This place has a very unique atmosphere which is very different than other sushi places in halifax. You can rather choose from ""private"" booths or traditional ""floor"" seating in the back. Make sure you order some sake, you get to choose your own sake glass from the various options they have. I would recommend this place if you wanted more of a private sushi dinner, whether romantic, or a more intimate dining experience with friends. They have an ordering system with a paper and pencil which makes it quick and easy to place your order, more time for talking! And drinking! I could argue they have one of the best tempura recipes in the city, and the most variety of vegetables."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Wish I had known about this place sooner. I regularly eat sushi and am always trying to find new places to eat, with friends or alone. On a recent rainy, Thursday evening, I had friends in town that had a Japanese craving and were staying at the Lord Nelson Hotel, so I suggested we try here since it's so close by, as well as a first for me. Very small inside, but cute atmosphere with several two-seater tables, three private booths with curtains, and two traditional tables in a room where you remove your footwear at the door and sit on a mattress on the floor. Luckily, they have an area under the tables dug out to put your feet, so you are actually sitting in the same position as you'd be at a normal table (no worry for those with back problems or anything). If I had one recommendation about this room, it would be to lower the lighting a little, as I found it a bit bright. Other than that, great service and great food. I tried the vegetable tempura, edamame and sweet potato tempura roll (all things I often get in sushi restaurants as a vegetarian). Very fresh. My friends had a fish platter and said it was great. I will definitely be back here."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,Just average sushi at best. Coming from the Westcoast we are spoiled but but poor flavours and messy presentation.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,The entrance looks tiny. you will have to know this to find the entrance. Lol It's a Japanese restaurant with interesting designs. The taste of food is also good. Lots of choices on the menu. Worth to give it a try if you like sushi and Japanese food. The score on this restaurant is fair.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,Best sushi house in Halifax.I am a big fan of sushi that doesn't have crazy sauce over it or too many toppings where you can't taste the quality of the fish or the rice. This is not the case here. Everything I've had on the menu tastes clean. Their rolls are delicious and the sashimi is soft and fresh.I also love the private little booths. So charming!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,I have been to a few sushi places around the world (none in Japan yet) but I can tell you that Suzuki sushi is by far my favourite so far. Excellent Sushi.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"A coworker and I braved the icy sidewalks to stop here for lunch while on a business trip from the US. We both got the sushi lunch combo, my coworker got the tuna roll and I got the salmon roll. I ordered 2 extra pieces of salmon nigiri, and my coworker ordered the sweet potato tempura.The sweet potato tempura serving size was huge and I ended up having to help, which was OK with me - it was delicious.I really enjoyed the quality of the fish, though I did find the nigiri had too much wasabi for me, though I'm not a wasabi guy. Having said that, I really enjoyed my lunch and felt it good value for the price."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Great place to take a date! Ask to be seated in the sitting room, especially if you want to impress your guests. Authentic-type decor. Very knowledgable staff. Japanese owned.Their nigiri sushi is my favourite in Halifax. The quality of their fish is consistently high and the rice is perfectly prepared. Consistently fresh and high quality ingredients are always used in the 10 or so times I've been there. They offer a selection of more traditional sushi as well as some contemporary rolls. One particular menu item they do extremely well is Unagi. As nigiri goes it is a generous serving of thick cut, grilled and generously sauced Unagi served on expertly prepared sushi rice to make one of the best bites of sushi in Halifax. PRO TIP: If you are going to order Nigiri sushi (or sashimi), ALWAYS ask for the chef's recommendation before deciding on your order. This gives them an opportunity to showcase their best quality fish of that day."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"I didn't even know this place existed until I went there with a friend. It is hidden away down a narrow ally. But, it is so cute! The atmosphere is pretty chill/relaxing; they have some average restaurant style tables and chairs - but - they also have a few booths with curtains for privacy and a neat little room that I can't even really explain, I guess Japanese style seating is pretty accurate. We were seated in the last mentioned place, you have to remove your shoes before entering the room; it was a fun experience, and quite comfortable. Our server was so lovely, polite, personable and attentive! She was great.The sushi was delicious!! I think it was some of the best I've had. The rice and ""fillings"" were still warm!! Which did make some of the larger pieces a little harder to eat, but it was absolutely delicious! Try their Suzuki Roll and green tea ice cream!I didn't pay, so I'm not sure what the total was for the two of us, but the prices seemed pretty decent!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Would never have found this place if not for a friend's recommendation. Delicious, simple sushi and tempura. Our waitress was great."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/suzuki-restaurant-halifax-2?hrid=rucUgObOZrUdlwPGheSuWw,Suzuki Restaurant,"Went there for take away. After looking at the menu, figuring out what I wanted, and ordering it, I was told it would be a 50min wait. I decided to wait for the food. The restaurant had a good selection, with some interesting specials.The makis I ordered were a bit squishy. Flavor was ok. Nigri was ok too."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"My wife and I stopped here for lunch on a rainy day on our road trip through Nova Scotia. The place was recommended to us by a young lady at our hotel. We couldn't have gone to a better restaurant. The service was quick. The food was amazing. To start, we had 2 Turkish coffees that came with Turkish pastries. They were great. We had roasted red pepper dip (ezo) for appetizer which was out of this world. I had the Chicken Doner and my wife had the chicken kebabs. Both were fantastic. The kebabs tasted like they were so carefully cooked because they were the juiciest and the most flavorful kebabs I have ever had. The portions were plenty. The owner offered us tea to finish the meal which was wonderful. Now we had turned our Turkish coffee cups upside down and we requested if the owner could read our fortunes. She said she didn't know how however the gentleman sitting behind us offered to do that for us. The owner ended up sitting down with us so she could learn how to read fortunes. We all ended up having a very pleasant and meaningful conversation about life over tea. In all, this is a great place with exceptional food and fast service that opens up opportunities to have great conversations with locals. So if you're in Halifax, and you want great Turkish food, stop by here. And who knows? The bearded man sitting and eating behind you might be named Shahab and he just might read your fortune."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,Great atmosphere as soon as one walks in. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is absolutely delicious - I hadn't tried much turkish cuisine before (besides hummus and falafels) and now I can't wait to try more! The ezo and borek definitely hit the spot! Highly recommend. The dishes are also very reasonably priced.Overall great experience.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,I was looking for a quick dinner that's near my hotel. Found Turkish delight and got take out. So I cannot comment much other than the food. And I wasn't disappointed! I got the lamb kofte kebop special. Big portion! I could not finish it and I was hungry! Tasted fresh too.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,A real delight. Restaurant doesn't look spectacular from the outside but don't be fooled. They have a good selection of lamb/chicken kabobs and other more traditional meals. Food was well prepared and it came with the right amount of salad and rice. We had the meze platter which was great for a starter. Service was really good. My friend brought his son and they made his meal like a face with a smile. That was certainly something you don't get everywhere. Interior is pleasant and clean. If you're looking for a good lunch downtown that's definitely a perfect spot.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,Right on spring garden yet this was the first time I went in. It looks like a run down place with very poor interiors. In fact they had a plastic cover inside hiding the repair work when we went in. The ambience really sucked. But the food was delicious and humongous proportions. Both of us had chicken schwarma. The service is good in fact great and very friendly. The restaurant is always crowded. If only they worked on the interiors and cheered it up! Great place to hang out with friends not so great for a date night.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"The best Turkish restaurant in Halifax, and the chicken kebap is so good!!!!!As their food are delicious and location are good, I recommended the restaurant to lots of my friends, and most of them are satisfied with their food there."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,I've ordered delivery from here twice after being impressed by the food quality and the speedy service. You definitely get your money's worth here. The borek is big compared to other Turkish restaurants in the vicinity of this place. The kebap quality is outstanding and the delivery guys are always professional and friendly. I definitely recommend this restaurant to all.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,Food is great love the kabab mix and mezza .. service is not as good but the food can compensate the service ..
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"I always knew that Turkish Delight was in Halifax but I never actually sat down to try the food. However now I've been here a total of 5 times and this restaurant has never disappointed me. I go on Fridays for the delicious lamb shank special, great price for a huge portion of tender lamb, rice, salad, and two sides of some sort of tomato/yoghurt sauces. Other days I've ordered their (again huge) wraps (lamb kofte, shish & beyti). As you can tell I'm a lover of lamb. All of these I would 100% recommend to any haligonian who would like a very delicious meal!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"I had the mixed kebap, came with chicken and lamb kabobs, basmati pilav and a turkish salad. Rice was great, nice and fluffy. Chicken and lamb was cooked to perfection with lots of flavour. Even enjoyed eating the salad and being a big eater I couldn't even finish everything on my plate! Great job and I'm sure I'll be back!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,Food was good and reasonably priced. Was there with friend for dinner. Good casual atmosphere. One down side was server was not too helpful or friendly.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,This very informal and affordable spot makes a delicious lamb kabob. The baclava was heated slightly and was a perfect finish. I can see why this spot gets rave reviews.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"I've eaten here occasionally since 2000-2001? been a while.. Although I don't like every single item on their menu (people are different) I have yet to be disappointed and I know I'll have a good meal every time I go there. If you haven't tried it, definitely worth it. The mixed kebab plate is a good way to sample."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,Amazing amazing! The food here is the best Turkish food I've had in North America so far. This is my gold standard for Turkish food in North America and everything gets compared to this in my mind.They have expanded the place significantly over the past 10 years with more seating. But the quality of food has remained the same. Everyone in Halifax knows about this place and it is a must-visit for anyone visiting the city. You will not be disappointed. Choose an item on the menu and chances are it will be good!
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"We eat in and order take out from here a lot. It is really good food - I recommend the lentil kofte or grilled shrimp. Staff and service are good, only had one slip up and we learned to check our take out before we walk home with it!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"Best fresh falafel I've had in a very long time! So crunchy on the outside and steamy soft in the middle. The servers are very welcoming and I don't feel awkward going in by myself for my lunchbreak. It's quite nice inside, the price is a bit high for me but not unrrasonable; the delicious food makes up for that."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,Chicken doner plate... Yum!! :) fresh fragrant ingredients always delicious and very filing when I have this for lunch at work.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"I wandered the streets of Halifax trying to find something to eat at 11:30, this place was the only place open that actually sounded good to me. I'm so glad it was. The decor is really neat, the table cloths remind me of Persian rugs but they weren't tacky, and there are a bunch of cool Turkish pictures in the store, I get an authentic vibe from this place. I ordered the chicken kofte kebab as it was one of the cheaper things on the menu, I guess why I would rate it 4 instead of 5 is because it was fairly expensive for a kebab house, most of the dishes were over $10. With that being said, my kofte kebab although expensive, was huge. I'd say almost a foot long. It was also extremely filling, I didn't finish even half of it before I got full. It had the most unique flavor I've ever tried, it was slightly spicy, slightly sour and the meat itself was pungent but in a really great way, it tasted fabulous with the rest of it. The service was great and fast and I can't wait to come back."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"Overpriced! 3 of us went for a Sunday lunch, 3 entrees with no appetizer, no drinks & no dessert, we walked out with a $75 bill (tip included). Yikes! I'm hoping this is because they don't offer specials on Sunday. Food was good but not worth $25 a person!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/turkish-delight-halifax?hrid=7s6d_qsG3lCjxzSeJY_jbQ,Turkish Delight,"Friendly bunch, their food was tasty.. Nice and simple presentation.. Menu is easy and prices are reasonable for the provided portions.. Parking is an issue though.."

It is Northern Chinese and it is very good!On Friday night my wife and I decided that we would go out and have supper. I suggested we go to A Taste of the East as I had just heard about it earlier that day. We knew it was brand new so we went in with no pre-conceived expectations. It is a small spot with probably only 8 tables, and there was already 5 of the tables occupied. We were greeted with a friendly smile and asked to take a seat at any of the remaining spots. She also said that they were busy so it might be a bit of a wait for our food. We looked over the menu and it was quite extensive, and not your standard ""Canadian"" Chinese offerings. We decided upon Wonton Soup (for 2), crunchy fried chicken and beef and black pepper sauce. I wanted to try the Goubuli style Bao (steamed pork filled buns) so we ordered 2 of those.We waited for our order and watched the others getting their food. Everything smelled really good and my wife commented several times on the unique serving dishes that everything was brought out on. I loved the Bao, but my wife didn't really care for them, so I ate hers. They were very soft but I found them very tasty. The beef in the pepper sauce was so tender and was probably the best I have ever eaten. The crunchy chicken was also really tender, and very lightly breaded. It came out cooked with cut up red chillies which added a subtle heat and nice flavour. The wonton soup also had a very nice flavour.I don't think we waited an unreasonable time considering she did warn us that they were busy, but she probably apologized two or three times about the wait. We probably ordered too much, even though we ate most of it. And the cost was very reasonable. This is definitely a place that we will be going back to try again!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/a-taste-of-the-east-halifax?hrid=CMXMHb1_rQWCfQ6tW0K9tw,A Taste of the East,"Had lunch there on Sunday. Great food, tried the chef's special fish in chili oil. We even asked for extra spicy, was really delicious as we love spicy food. The chicken with pepper was also really good. If you like some authentic Chinese food., it's definitely the place to go. Great service and great food. Will definitely go there next time."

Bonus, this time around its local, homemade stuff instead of coming off the back of a Sysco truck.The dairy bar has a compact menu befitting its physical size, with caffeinated offerings like espresso and cappuccino, as well as a new-to-me concept - nitrogen-infused coffee, which gives it a slight effervescence and head like Guinness. On the dairy side of things, there are frequently changing selections of soft serve, in cone and cup formats, even fancier sundaes, as well as locally made popsicles. On their first day of being open (yeah yeah, I'm a keener), I popped by on my way to catch the bus to the strip mall capital of Halifax, Sackville. I kept it simple, going for the creative black sesame seed soft serve cone. It seems like crushed seeds were added directly to the soft serve, as it had a grey hue, as well as some being sprinkled on top. It was smooth and creamy like a great soft serve should be, easily giving way to my licks. The sesame seeds added some additional pops of nutty flavour, and just the tiniest crunches. I'm looking forward to hitting up both Stillwell and the Manual Co. Dairy Bar over the course of the summer, as they bring more vibrancy (re. tasty food and beer) to downtown Halifax."

So when I heard that Krave Burger was a thing, it was a no brainer that I had to go and try it out.Since then I've been a returning customer and probably one of their biggest fans. I've tried the Krave Burger, Bacon Cheese Burger, and the Smoking Goat Burger and they're all amazing, mouth watering burgers. I usually stick to just the Krave Burger when I go because it's simple but filled with flavour which is what I like best. The fries are soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and make a perfect match with anything on the menu. The atmosphere is super fun with a modern diner vibe and the staff are always awesome and extremely friendly.I recommend this joint to anybody and everybody as they also have other great things on the menu if you're not the burger type!"

Most places that I asked for that said they couldn't do it (which didn't make any sense to me, but I didn't bother making a stink of it). I just didn't eat the bun.Even that aside though - the staff that work there are always so unbelievably friendly and attentive. I love going in there just for that. But the great tasting food always helps.Every time I've gone in there there's a line up out the door - which clearly shows that whatever they're doing, is working. Keep it up."

The gourmet burger thing has been popular around the world, but my lunch here this week was one of the tastiest.Big choice of burgers, and not just like everywhere else. Mine had smoked bacon and a slice of goat cheese, very tangy, and it worked well with the beef patty. The fries were nice too.Service was sharp and fast, they bring the meal to your table, and they clean up after you too. I liked the space, too: fast-food, but a little nicer than most. Like, premium fast-food. And they're licensed!If you're OK with leaving your ID they'll give you a USB charging cable for your phone while you eat."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"Really liked this place. Super close to our hotel and needed a burger. Busy street with lots of options. Stopped in and our order taker gave some good suggestions. Double burger with goat cheese and a chicken sandwich. Got sweet potato fries and poutine too. Everything was very solid. Good, unique flavors, fresh and nicely cooked. Would go back for sure if I didn't live 1000 miles away... If our foody front of the house dude reads this, come to Chicago for Au Cheval, Portillo's, and Pequods. Will make it worth the trip..."

The fries and onion rings are also excellent. I usually get the regular burger +bacon and cheese, and I've never been disappointed."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"This one is clean, with lots of TV's, big and small, near and far from your table. Oh and the tables have lots of USB charging ports for your devices to fill up as you do ;)The food was great. Poutine side....Crispy fries, with a fresh cheese curd and not too salty gravy. The barnyard burger was so good, I can't imagine what could be better on the menu. Also nice cold beer and decent service. I'd go back for sure."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,Tasty burger. It's nothing flash just a good burger with good meat and tasty sides. Salad was super tasty. Relativity cheap. You get what you pay for. But if your in the area and wants a tasty bite one can go wrong.
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"A bit pricey with meals at 15$ for a ""burger + sides+drink"" but it tastes much better than your average burger. I probably go here once a week on average because of my fave the smoking goat burger which has goat cheese on it. Note that they have a free toppings list when you order so add those if you want more than what's already on your burger."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"I was downtown for the Open City weekend, and my girlfriend really wanted to try Krave's offering as we came out of the ATM on SGR. I told her I wouldn't dare pay for it after the last time I went here and sure enough, it was extremely disappointing. 5$ for about 2 thin strips of insipid Mr. Donair on two burger bun bottoms with flavourless cheese. The best thing here was the donair sauce.Krave continues to unimpress."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"I am a big burger fan and try to go to as many places as I can. This is definitely one of my favourites for a number of reasons:1. The size is appropriate. You walk away full but not stuffed beyond belief. Too many burger joints focus on size not quality. 2. The range of choices is plentiful but not overwhelming. 3. The space is clean and bright with the major bonus of USB charging stations for cell phones at every seat.4. They have beer on tap.Burgers, beer and great side dishes make this spot a must try for burger lovers."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"A friend recommended krave.Hard to find for an out of towner. I had it down to the bork and steakhouse burgers. I asked the friendly cashier whick i shiuld go with and she said the steakhouse. So I ordered the steakhouse and a side poutine, fries extra crispy of course(followers like KREAMAIRE know i like my fries crispy, thanks KREAMAIRE )The poutine was ok. The burger was very tasty. It was not a giant size but it was a good size. Quality is there"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"A recently opened burger joint on SGR, Krave is nicely filling the downtown gap left by the exit of The Works. McDonald's can't be the Spring Garden burger place, it just can't. It's got a fast food-ish interior, but more modern and less corporate feeling. The bold red, white and black palate makes for an exportable brand, mind you. Bar seating close to the doors and those seats and tables by the walls have convenient USB plugs for your electronic device charging needs. Kudos. A large menu on the wall by the cash registers has several burgers, hot dogs and sides, as well as a list of items for a make-your-own burger. They also have a liquor license, so if you're not heading into work like I was, you can get some beer or boozey milkshakes with your meal. Which you probably should.I wanted to keep it simple to get a baseline of what their burgers were like and yet not completely over eat before my night shift, so I went with the bacon cheeseburger combo, but resisted the temptation of their sides other than the fries which came with my combo. Cup in hand, I was glad to see they had ginger ale on tap, a rarity at these sort of places.Minutes before the Parade of Lights, the place was bustling with hungry people and those here for the free hot chocolate. Luckily I was able to grab a small two-person table so that I had room for my work baggage, but wasn't putting out too many people from a seat. It was a little bit of a wait, perhaps seeming longer since I was by myself, but as soon as I was wondering what was up, I had my tray of burger and fries in front of me. Krave's food is presented simply in the old school fast food joint fashion, in open paper wrappers showing off a damn good looking burger. One of their house-ground patties topped with melted cheddar, a few slices of their shoulder bacon, and the usual vegetable suspects, it was a sight for hungry eyes. The first bite matched the taste with the looks; it was a very good burger. The beef had great flavour and a nice texture to it; not too loose and crumbly, but not such a fine grind and compressed that it's sausage-like. The shoulder bacon had a slightly different flavour than any belly bacon I've ever had, and it added a nice salty and smoky hit to each bite. The bun held it all together nicely without being so thick that it was a distraction or hard to chew through. Pretty much a perfectly executed burger.The fries weren't quite at the level of the burger unfortunately, although I feel like they easily could have been. Skin on, and probably double fried, mine were a bit cold and tough, suggesting that they were sitting around waiting for my burger to come off the grill. It was an exceptionally busy night for them, but consistency is a hallmark of the greats, or those aspiring to that level.The meal was the ideal size, filling my empty belly but not so much that I'd be wanting a nap right after I got to work. Service was friendly throughout, and smiling faces were checking in on everyone to see how meals were coming along; a nice touch.Krave is putting out a great product, in a clean, crisp environment with some nice amenities, and I look forward to returning in the future for some more food and a boozey milkshake."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"Good burgers albeit pricey, with Rockbottom only a few steps away I'd prefer their burgers. I got the steakhouse burger and a poutine. Both were delicious but I was surprised the patty was rather small for a burger joint. The horseradish mayo was also pretty overpowering which isn't up my alley but I can see the appeal. Check out Cheese Curds in Dartmouth if you want a better burger experience in my opinion."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"Finally had a chance to check out Krave burger today. I got the bacon cheese burger with poutine and the very (straw)berry milkshake.First off I always get milkshakes when I have the chance and this was one of if not the best I've ever had, certainly the best that I've had in recent memory. The poutine was also excellent with a solid ratio of all the key ingredient. The burger was also exemplary. All and all definitely the gourmet burger place I would recommend most highly of the several in HRM."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"So I haven't yelped about anything for a few years now. In fact I had to create a whole new Yelp profile, just for this! Not that I haven't been eating (as if!) but I guess I just lacked inspiration. Until now. Until...the Krave Burger. Oh my.My son and I were walking down Spring Garden a few weeks back and stumbled upon this gem. The entrance is kind of hidden so you need to look for it, but do that. You'll be glad you did.First off, great environment. Simple, modern, bright and clean. There are even flat screen TVs (if you fancy some entertainment while you wait for your scrumptious burger), AND, wait for it.....they're licensed! Service was fantastic. Super attentive server and Krave ambassador, AJ, was delightful! I wanted to hug him but I controlled myself.Anyway, most important....the food is amazing! Fresh locally sourced beef made for the most delicious and succulent burger. There were so many tempting choices but I went ""Classic"" to start. A wise choice. I love you, Ace Burger, but this was cray. Even the home cut fries were incredible. And my son said his strawberry milkshake was the best he ever had! I wouldn't know because he drank it all, but I believe it!It's my birthday this weekend and of all the places I could choose to eat, this is where I want to go.So, AJ....will see you shortly. Jumpy claps!"
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"While they only offer one vegan burger on the menu, it's super nice they offer at least that. I love the modern feel of the joint with the red and white decor. The girl working was super friendly and helpful. You do have to mention you want no butter on the bun to make it vegan but apparently they even have a button for that on the register so it's super convenient, no questions asked. The burger has a south western kind feel with corn, black beans, sweet potatoes and appropriate spices. I enjoyed it but loved the fries even more. Fresh cut fries cooked to perfection. Even as a vegan you can get fast food in Halifax, that always makes a girl happy."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"This is one of the best Burger Places in Halifax, hands down. I've been here about 3 times and I've yet to be disappointed. On my latest trip, I ordered the Bacon and Cheese Burger with a ""(Very)Strawberry"" Milkshake. This was during a Power Outage and the payment system was down, so they let me order my food and have a seat while they worked out the problem. The Burger, although greasy was delicious. The Beef was well cooked, but not overly so, The cheese was slightly melted and the bacon was well cooked as well. The veggie topping where fresh, crisp and flavorful The shake was also very good.Not a lot of filler and the flavor was good. Service was prompt and friendly. I can't recommend Krave Burger enough. If your looking for a good burger in the South End, this should be your first stop."
https://www.yelp.ca/biz/krave-burger-halifax?hrid=4s-2qNrQJ6DXWCTsVi1J9w,Krave Burger,"First let me say it was Mike's idea to come here. :-D Krave is just like the other ""gourmet"" and ""specialty"" burger joints: long-winded in their descriptions of their locally-sourced, no-fillered and super-duper meat, but short on taste. The resto itself looks like a fast-food version of an Apple store: very white, very pristine and very soulless. We both tried the traditional burger and fries combo. At over $20 for two combos? I was expecting something pretty good. Unfortunately it was very ""meh.""I like the portable table numbering system. I like the TVs showing sports (although they were all on the same station, which is not the norm). The staff were all very friendly and we were given a sample of chocolate shake. I like that we can leave the trays on the tables rather than having to sort everything in the different garbage/recycling containers. But the food wasn't that great. The burgers had little flavour and were quite small for the price. The fries were overcooked and tough. Mike is much more forgiving than me when it comes to eating out, and even he was disappointed. Plus the washrooms aren't clean, or they weren't when I tried to use them.I'm sure I've said this before, but if I want a good burger? I'll stick with Durty Nelly's."
