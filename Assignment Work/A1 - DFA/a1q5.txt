Ans 5 b)

Words that this DFA accepts can be described as:-

a(!b)*b(!a)*aa*(!a(!a)*aa*)*

1. First alphabet has to be an "a".
2. Then any alphabet except "b", which can be repeated 0 or more times.
3. Followed by alphabet "b".
4. Then any alphabet except "a", which can be repeated 0 or more times.
5. Next alphabet has to be an "a".
6. Followed by 0 or more alphabet "a".
7. Then after this, any alphabet except "a", followed by any alphabet except 
"a" repeated 0 or more times. Then followed by next alphabet as "a" and followed 
by alphabet "a" repeated 0 or more times.
8. And this step 7 can be repeated 0 or more times.

This leads us to the final stage i.e. the words that will be accepted.
